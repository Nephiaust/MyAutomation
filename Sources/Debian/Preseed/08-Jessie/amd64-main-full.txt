# d-i apt-setup/security_host string security.debian.org

### Description: Services to use:
#   Debian has two services that provide updates to releases: security and
#   release updates.
#   .
#   Security updates help to keep your system secured against attacks. Enabling
#   this service is strongly recommended.
#   .
#   Release updates provide more current versions for software that changes
#   relatively frequently and where not having the latest version could reduce
#   the usability of the software. It also provides regression fixes.
#   This service is only available for stable and oldstable releases.
#   .
#   Backported software are adapted from the development version to work with
#   this release. Although this software has not gone through such complete
#   testing as that contained in the release, it includes newer versions of
#   some applications which may provide useful features. Enabling backports
#   here does not cause any of them to be installed by default; it only

### Description: Drivers to include in the initrd:
#   The primary function of an initrd is to allow the kernel to mount the

#   .
#   A generic initrd is much larger than a targeted one and may even be so
#   large that some boot loaders are unable to load it but has the advantage that
#   it can be used to boot the target system on almost any hardware. With the

### Description: Keep default keyboard options (${XKBOPTIONS})?
#   The default value for the options of the keyboard layout is
#   XKBOPTIONS="${XKBOPTIONS}".  It is based on the currently defined
#   language/region and the settings in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
#   .
#   If you choose to keep it, no questions about the keyboard options
#   will be asked.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/unsupported_options boolean true

### Description: Method for toggling between national and Latin mode:
#   You will need a way to toggle the keyboard between the national
#   layout and the standard Latin layout.
#   .
#   Right Alt or Caps Lock keys are often chosen for ergonomic reasons
#   (in the latter case, use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps
#   toggle). Alt+Shift is also a popular combination; it will
#   however lose its usual behavior in Emacs and other programs
#   that use it for specific needs.
#   .
#   Not all listed keys are present on all keyboards.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/toggle select Alt+Shift
# Possible choices: Caps Lock, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Shift, Right Logo key, Menu key, Alt+Shift, Control+Shift, Control+Alt, Alt+Caps Lock, Left Control+Left Shift, Left Alt, Left Control, Left Shift, Left Logo key, Scroll Lock key, No toggling

### Description: Method for temporarily toggling between national and Latin input:
#   When the keyboard is in national mode and one wants to type only a few
#   Latin letters, it might be more appropriate to switch temporarily to
#   Latin mode. The keyboard remains in that mode as long as the chosen key is
#   kept pressed. That key may also be used to input national letters when
#   the keyboard is in Latin mode.
#   .
#   You can disable this feature by choosing "No temporary switch".
# d-i keyboard-configuration/switch select No temporary switch
# Possible choices: No temporary switch, Both Logo keys, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Logo key, Left Alt, Left Logo key

### Description: Key to function as AltGr:
#   With some keyboard layouts, AltGr is a modifier key used to input
#   some characters, primarily ones that are unusual for the language of the
#   keyboard layout, such as foreign currency symbols and accented letters.
#   These are often printed as an extra symbol on keys.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/altgr select Right Alt (AltGr)
# Possible choices: The default for the keyboard layout, No AltGr key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Alt, Left Logo key, Keypad Enter key, Both Logo keys, Both Alt keys

### Description: Compose key:
#   The Compose key (known also as Multi_key) causes the computer to interpret
#   the next few keystrokes as a combination in order to produce a character
#   not found on the keyboard.
#   .
#   On the text console the Compose key does not work in Unicode mode. If not
#   in Unicode mode, regardless of what you choose here, you can always also
#   use the Control+period combination as a Compose key.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/compose select No compose key
# Possible choices: No compose key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Logo key, Caps Lock

### Description: Use Control+Alt+Backspace to terminate the X server?
#   By default the combination Control+Alt+Backspace does nothing.  If
#   you want it can be used to terminate the X server.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/ctrl_alt_bksp boolean false

#   .
#   If all of your operating systems are listed above, then it should be safe to

#   drive. When your computer boots, you will be able to choose to load one of
#   these operating systems or your new system.
# d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true

### Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
#   It seems that this new installation is the only operating system
#   on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader
#   to the master boot record of your first hard drive.
#   .
#   Warning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system that
#   is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make
#   that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually
#   configured later to boot it.
# d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

### Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the Serial ATA RAID disk?
#   Installation of GRUB on Serial ATA RAID is experimental.
#   .
#   GRUB is always installed to the master boot record (MBR) of the
#   Serial ATA RAID disk. It is also assumed that disk is listed as the
#   first hard disk in the boot order defined in the system's BIOS setup.
#   .
#   The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.
# d-i grub-installer/sataraid boolean true

### Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the multipath device?
#   Installation of GRUB on multipath is experimental.

#   The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.
# d-i grub-installer/multipath boolean true

### Description: Device for boot loader installation:
#   You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing
#   the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
#   install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you
#   prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive,
#   or even to a floppy.
#   .
#   The device should be specified as a device in /dev. Below are some
#   examples:
#    - "/dev/sda" will install GRUB to the master boot record of your first
#      hard drive;
#    - "/dev/sda2" will use the second partition of your first hard drive;
#    - "/dev/sdc5" will use the first extended partition of your third hard

### Description: GRUB password:
#   The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could

#   machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a
#   password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the
#   GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to
#   start any menu entry without entering the password.
#   .
#   If you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.

### Description: Install GRUB?
#   GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB, the boot loader that is commonly

#   .
#   It has interesting new features but is still experimental software
#   for this architecture. If you choose to install it, you should be prepared
#   for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it

### Description: Force GRUB installation to the EFI removable media path?
#   It seems that this computer is configured to boot via EFI, but maybe
#   that configuration will not work for booting from the hard
#   drive. Some EFI firmware implementations do not meet the EFI
#   specification (i.e. they are buggy!) and do not support proper
#   configuration of boot options from system hard drives.
#   .
#   A workaround for this problem is to install an extra copy of the EFI
#   version of the GRUB boot loader to a fallback location, the
#   "removable media path". Almost all EFI systems, no matter how buggy,
#   will boot GRUB that way.
#   .
#   Warning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system
#   that is present on your computer that also depends on this fallback,
#   installing GRUB there will make that operating system temporarily
#   unbootable. GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it if
#   necessary.

#   prefer, the installer can mount filesystems based on the traditional device
#   names, or based on a label you assign. However, note that traditional
#   device names may change based on the order in which the kernel discovers
#   devices at boot, which may cause the wrong filesystem to be mounted;
#   similarly, labels are likely to clash if you plug in a new disk or a USB
#   drive, and if that happens your system's behaviour when started will be

### Description: Allow login as root?
#   If you choose not to allow root to log in, then a user account will be
#   created and given the power to become root using the 'sudo' command.
# d-i passwd/root-login boolean true

### Description: Root password:
#   You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative
#   account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have
#   disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password
#   that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries,
#   or a word that could be easily associated with you.
#   .
#   A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
#   and should be changed at regular intervals.
#   .
#   The root user should not have an empty password. If you leave this
#   empty, the root account will be disabled and the system's initial user
#   account will be given the power to become root using the "sudo"
#   command.
#   .
#   Note that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.
# d-i passwd/root-password password <password>

### Description: Re-enter password to verify:
#   Please enter the same root password again to verify that you have typed it
#   correctly.
# d-i passwd/root-password-again password <password>

### Description: Create a normal user account now?
#   It's a bad idea to use the root account for normal day-to-day activities,
#   such as the reading of electronic mail, because even a small mistake can
#   result in disaster. You should create a normal user account to use for
#   those day-to-day tasks.
#   .
#   Note that you may create it later (as well as any additional account) by
#   typing 'adduser <username>' as root, where <username> is an username,
#   like 'imurdock' or 'rms'.
# d-i passwd/make-user boolean true

### Description: Full name for the new user:
#   A user account will be created for you to use instead of the root

#   .
#   Please enter the real name of this user. This information will be used
#   for instance as default origin for emails sent by this user as well as
#   any program which displays or uses the user's real name. Your full
#   name is a reasonable choice.
# d-i passwd/user-fullname string <string>

### Description: Username for your account:
#   Select a username for the new account. Your first name is a reasonable choice.
#   The username should start with a lower-case letter, which can be
#   followed by any combination of numbers and more lower-case letters.
# d-i passwd/username string <string>

### Description: Choose a password for the new user:
#   A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
#   and should be changed at regular intervals.

### Description: Re-enter password to verify:
#   Please enter the same user password again to verify you have typed it

# d-i passwd/user-password-again password <password>

### Description: Enable shadow passwords?
#   Shadow passwords make your system more secure because nobody is able to
#   view even encrypted passwords. The passwords are stored in a separate file
#   that can only be read by special programs. The use of shadow passwords
#   is strongly recommended, except in a few cases such as NIS environments.

############################
#### adjtimex_1.29-3_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Should adjtimex be run at installation and at every startup?
#   Running adjtimex at system startup will set the kernel time parameters to

#   .
#   You should not choose this option if you just want to
#   use adjtimex to inspect the current parameters.
# d-i adjtimex/run_daemon boolean true

### Description: Run adjtimexconfig when adjtimex is installed or upgraded?
#   The adjtimexconfig script will use adjtimex to find values for the kernel
#   variables "tick" and "frequency" that will make the system clock approximately
#   agree with the hardware clock (also known as the CMOS clock).  It then
#   saves these values in the configuration file /etc/default/adjtimex so the
#   settings will be restored on every boot, when /etc/init.d/adjtimex runs.
#   .
#   The script takes 70 seconds to run, so running it for every upgrade
#   may be a waste of time. Alternatively, you can run adjtimexconfig
#   manually when needed, or determine the kernel variables by using other
#   methods and set them manually in /etc/default/adjtimex.

# d-i aide/aideinit boolean false

### Description: Overwrite existing /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new?

### Description: Copy aide.db.new to aide.db?
#   It is advisable for you to first look over /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new
#   file before replacing the existing db. You can have the package
#   replace the database anyway here.
#   .
#   If you do not choose this option, you will need to copy the file

#### am-utils_6.2+rc20110530-3.2_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: for internal use
# d-i am-utils/import-amd-conf-done boolean false

### Description: Import old amd configuration?
#   amd package configuration files are available (the "amd" package was
#   the precursor to am-utils)
#   .
#   A mechanism is available to import these files, but it may fail
#   in some cases.
# d-i am-utils/import-amd-conf boolean false

### Description: Is the amd master map propagated through NIS?
#   At large sites the automounter tables (called 'maps') may be available
#   through the "Network Information Service", or NIS for short (formerly known
#   as "Yellow pages").  This is the recommended way of using the automounter
#   on client systems.
#   .
#   The master map contains the list of mount points to be managed by amd.
#   This master map can be propagated through NIS or can be a file. Whatever
#   answer you choose here does not prevent amd from retrieving the other maps
#   via NIS.
#   .
#   Only the *master* map is concerned here.
# d-i am-utils/use-nis boolean false

### Description: Name of the master map:
#   The master map is the map containing amd's startup arguments and refers to
#   other maps.
#   .
#   It's generally called "amd.master".
# d-i am-utils/nis-master-map string amd.master

### Description: Master map style:
#   The Amd master map can be of different styles:
#   .
#   With the `config' style, every key in the master map specifies a different
#   configuration. You might have different configurations depending on which
#   OS is booted, or on what the machine's purpose is. The value associated
#   with each key is the list of mountpoints and maps to be used with this
#   configuration.
#   .
#   Example map:
#   .
#    linux   /home amd.home /boot amd.boot -cache:=all
#    freebsd /home amd.home /usr/sys amd.usr-sys
#   .
#   You will need to specify which key to use.
#   .
#   The `onekey' style is the same as `config' except there is only one single
#   configuration. No key needs to be specified.
#   .
#   With the `mountpoint' style, every key in the master map is the mount
#   point and the value is the map name to be used for this mount point, plus
#   some options if needed. This is the default map style for FreeBSD.
#   .
#   Example map:
#   .
#    /home amd.home
#    /boot amd.boot -cache:=all
#   .
#   With the `custom' style, you will be prompted for a command to extract the
#   master map which will be run everytime amd starts.
# d-i am-utils/nis-master-map-key-style select onekey
# Possible choices: config, onekey, mountpoint, custom

### Description: NIS key to use for this system:
#   The key is typically the name of the os ("linux" for example), or a
#   description of this computer's usage ("marketing", "r&d", etc).
# d-i am-utils/nis-key string default

### Description: Command to run to extract the master map:
#   Please enter a shell command to run when amd starts up. This command
#   should print a valid list of amd command line maps on stdout.
# d-i am-utils/nis-custom string echo "/amd-is-misconfigured /usr/share/am-utils/amd.net"

### Description: Use the 'net' map?
#   Amd can be configured to use the net map. With this map, one can access
#   all the filesystems exported via NFS from a particular host by looking
#   under:
#      /net/<HOSTNAME>/<FILESYSTEM>
#   .
#   While convenient, this can result in mounting a lot of filesystems
#   simultaneously.
# d-i am-utils/map-net boolean true

### Description: Use the passwd map?
#   A map for automounting of home directories on /home.
#   .
#   If you use the following system for the home directories of
#   your users, then you will not need to do any configuration, because amd
#   provides a special "passwd" map type for this case. Amd will break the
#   string
#   .
#    /anydir/[dom1[/...]/]domN/login
#   .
#   to:
#   .
#    rfs:=/anydir/domN
#    rhost:=domN[[....].dom1]
#    sublink:=login
#   .
#   If your home directories do *not* follow this pattern, you should not enable
#   this feature.
# d-i am-utils/map-home boolean false

### Description: Other maps to use:
#   If you need to use other maps, enter them here.
#   .
#   A map entry requires the two following elements:
#     1. A mount point (where the map will be mounted and accessed)
#     2. The name of a map, in a text file, DBM file, or the name of a
#        NIS map.
#   .
#   For example, if you have a text map in /etc/am-utils/amd.test to be
#   mounted on /foo and a NIS map called amd.other to be mounted on /bar, then
#   you should enter:
#   .
#    /foo /etc/am-utils/amd.test /bar amd.other
# d-i am-utils/map-others string <string>

### Description: Cluster name to use:
#   A map entry can use the '\${cluster}' selector, to identify a machine as
#   belonging to a particular cluster.  
#   .
#   If you use that facility, set the cluster name here.  If you leave it
#   blank, amd will use the DNS domain name instead.
# d-i am-utils/clustername string <string>

############################

### Description: Automatic remapping of client requests:
#   Apt-Cacher NG can download packages from repositories other than those
#   requested by the clients. This allows it to cache content effectively,
#   and makes it easy for an administrator to switch to another mirror later.
#   The URL remapping can be set up automatically, using a configuration
#   based on the current state of /etc/apt/sources.list.
#   .
#   Please specify whether the remapping should be configured once now, or
#   reconfigured on every update of Apt-Cacher NG (modifying the

#   Each entry must be an IP address or hostname associated with a local
#   network interface. Generic protocol-specific addresses are also
#   supported, such as 0.0.0.0 for listening on all IPv4-enabled interfaces.
#   .
#   If this field is left empty, Apt-Cacher NG will listen on all
#   interfaces, with all supported protocols.
#   .
#   The special word "keep" keeps the value from the current (or default)
#   configuration unchanged.
# d-i apt-cacher-ng/bindaddress string keep

### Description: Listening TCP port:
#   Please specify the TCP port that Apt-Cacher NG should listen on for

# d-i apt-listchanges/email-address string root

### Description: Prompt for confirmation after displaying changes?
#   After displaying the list of changes, apt-listchanges can pause with
#   a confirmation prompt. This is useful when running from APT, as it
#   offers an opportunity to abort the upgrade if a change is unwelcome.
#   .
#   This can be overridden at execution time, and has no effect if the
#   configured frontend option is 'mail' or 'none'.
# d-i apt-listchanges/confirm boolean false

### Description: Should apt-listchanges skip changes that have already been seen?
#   A record of already displayed changes can be kept in order to avoid
#   displaying them again. This is useful, for example, when retrying an upgrade.
# d-i apt-listchanges/save-seen boolean true

### Description: Initialize the apt-listdifferences source packages database now?
#   The source packages database for apt-listdifferences can be initialized now.
#   Depending on your Internet connection, this may take a while, but it will also
#   provide immediate functionality for the tool.
#   .
#   If you do not choose this option, apt-listdifferences will instead become functional slowly
#   over time as more and more reference source packages get added to its database
#   when they are first seen.
# d-i apt-listdifferences/initialize boolean true

### Description: Remove the apt-listdifferences source packages database?
#   The apt-listdifferences source packages database is currently still present on disk. You can save

#### arno-iptables-firewall_2.0.1.e-1_all.deb
############################

### description: External network interfaces:
#   The external network interfaces connect this machine
#   to untrusted networks (e.g. the Internet). The firewall will only permit
#   connections attempts with explicitly allowed source/destination-port
#   combinations on these interfaces. You have to specify all external
#   interfaces (e.g. eth0 and/or ppp0).
#   .
#   For a ppp-interface that doesn't exist yet you can use the wildcard device
#   called "ppp+", but you can only use ppp+ if there aren't any other ppp
#   interfaces!
#   .
#   If no interfaces are specified here, no firewall setup will
#   be performed.
#   .
#   Multiple interfaces should be specified space separated.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-ext-if string <string>

### description: Is DHCP used on external interfaces?
#   This machine might use DHCP to dynamically obtain its IP address from
#   your Internet service provider (ISP). This will be almost always the case
#   if you have a non-permanent (e.g. dialup) connection.
#   .
#   If DHCP is not explicitly enabled, the firewall will block all DHCP-related
#   network traffic.
#   .
#   Leave this enabled, if you are unsure.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/dynamic-ip boolean true

### description: Open external TCP-ports:
#   The default firewall policy is to deny all incoming traffic on the
#   external interfaces. If this machine provides services to the outside
#   world (e.g. the Internet) they have to be explicitly enabled.
#   .
#   Please specify the TCP-ports numbers associated with the services that
#   shall be accessible from the outside world. Some frequently used ports are: 80
#   (http), 443 (https) or 22 (ssh).
#   .
#   In addition to single port numbers you may also specify port ranges (e.g.
#   10000:11000). Multiple entries should be entered space separated.
#   .
#   If unsure, leave this empty.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/services-tcp string <string>

### description: Open external UDP-ports:
#   The default firewall policy is to deny all incoming traffic on the
#   external interfaces. If this machine provides services for the outside
#   world (e.g. the Internet) they have to be explicitly enabled.
#   .
#   Please specify the UDP-ports numbers associated with the services that
#   shall be accessible from the outside world.
#   .
#   In addition to single port numbers you may also specify port ranges (e.g.
#   10000:11000). Multiple entries should be entered space separated.
#   .
#   If unsure, leave this empty.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/services-udp string <string>

### description: Should the firewall be (re)started now?
#   For security reasons the new firewall setup is not applied
#   automatically. You might want to perform a manual inspection of the
#   firewall configuration in /etc/arno-iptables-firewall/firewall.conf, especially
#   when upgrading to a new version, as configuration variables might have changed.
#   .
#   In order to later manually apply the new
#   firewall settings before the next reboot, invoke 'invoke-rc.d
#   arno-iptables-firewall start'.
#   .
#   If you do not need manual inspection, the firewall-setup can be applied now.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/restart boolean true

### description: Do you want to enable NAT?
#   If the connected internal networks should be able to access the outside
#   world (e.g. the Internet) through the firewall, masquerading (NAT) has
#   to be enabled.
#   .
#   When in doubt, you can safely leave this disabled.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/nat boolean false

### description: Internal network interfaces:
#   The internal network interfaces connect this machine
#   to trusted networks (e.g. the office or home LAN). The firewall will permit
#   all connection attempts on these interfaces. If you specify such interfaces,
#   you will be able to permit the internal networks to access the Internet through
#   this host. If there are no such interfaces, leave this empty.
#   .
#   Multiple interfaces should be entered space separated.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-int-if string <string>

### description: Internal subnets:
#   You have to specify which subnets are connected to the internal network
#   interfaces. Hosts in the internal networks can connect to all the services on
#   this machine.
#   .
#   Give subnets in CIDR notation (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24). If you have
#   multiple internal networks, they should be space separated.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-int-net string <string>

### description: Internal networks with access to external networks:
#   If you want to restrict the access to the external networks, you can specify
#   the allowed internal subnets in CIDR notation (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24). It is
#   also possible to specify single hosts by their IP addresses. If you have
#   multiple internal networks and/or hosts, they should be given space separated.
#   .
#   If you leave this empty, the value is automatically set to equal the internal
#   network. Therefore the WHOLE internal network will have access to the external
#   networks, so be careful to only specify networks that should have access to
#   the outside world.
#   .
#   If you are unsure, leave this empty.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-int-nat-net string <string>

### description: Should the machine be pingable from the outside world?
#   For increased security the firewall can be setup to ignore ICMP echo
#   requests (pings). While this is generally a good idea (the host seems to
#   be down at a first glance), this is sometimes not useful (e.g. failure
#   diagnostics).
#   .
#   If you are not sure, leave this disabled.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/icmp-echo boolean false

### description: Do you want to manage the firewall setup with debconf?
#   A basic firewall setup that is suitable for most purposes can be created by
#   answering a few questions. This should be the preferred option for all who are
#   not familiar with firewall-related topics.
#   .
#   If you do not want that, the firewall will not work before you have edited
#   the configuration manually.

#   Enabling this feature will dump the files pointed by symlinks and
#   is likely to generate huge archives.
# d-i backup-manager/dump_symlinks boolean false

### Description: Directories to skip in archives:
#   Please enter a space-separated list of directories which should not be
#   archived.
# d-i backup-manager/blacklist string /var/archives

### Description: Archives name format:
#   Files generated by backup-manager may use different file naming
#   conventions.
#   .
#   The long format is "host-full-path-to-directory.tar.gz" while the short
#   format only uses the last directory name. For instance, /home/me
#   would be named me.tar.gz.
# d-i backup-manager/name-format select long
# Possible choices: long, short

### Description: Age of kept archives (days):
#   Please choose the number of days backup-manager will keep the files
#   before purging them. Combining several directories and a large number of
#   days for keeping them may lead to huge archives.
# d-i backup-manager/time-to-live string 5

### Description: Directories to backup:
#   Please enter a space-separated list of all the directories you want
#   to backup.
#   .
#   You should rather enter several subdirectories instead of the
#   parent in order to have more pertinent files in your backup repository.
#   .
#   For instance, "/home/user1 /home/user2 /home/user3" is more appropriate
#   than "/home" alone.
# d-i backup-manager/directories string /etc /home

### Description: Enable automatic burning?
#   Archives may be burnt on a CDR/CDRW/DVD media.
#   .
#   Using this feature requires a writable media to be present at the running
#   time.
# d-i backup-manager/burning-enabled boolean false

### Description: Device to use for burning data:
# d-i backup-manager/burning-device string /dev/cdrom

### Description: Maximum size of your media (MB):
# d-i backup-manager/burning-maxsize string 650

### Description: Burning method:
#   When burning data, backup-manager will try to burn the whole archives
#   repository. If it does not fit in the media, it will try to burn only the
#   daily generated archives.
#   .
#   The CDRW/DVD-RW methods will first blank the media and then burn the data.
#   .
#   The CDR/DVD method will only burn the data, assuming that the media is empty
#   (or that the disc does not need formatting, like DVD+RW).
# d-i backup-manager/burning-method select CDRW
# Possible choices: CDRW, CDR, DVD, DVD-RW

### Description: Enable backup-manager's uploading system?
#   Archives may be uploaded to remote hosts using ftp or ssh.
#   .
#   Using this feature requires valid ftp or ssh account on remote hosts.
# d-i backup-manager/want_to_upload boolean false

### Description: Transfer mode to use:
#   The "ftp" transfer mode requires a valid FTP account on remote hosts.
#   .
#   The "scp" mode requires a valid SSH account on remote hosts.
#   SSH Key authentication is used to establish the connection.
# d-i backup-manager/transfert_mode select scp
# Possible choices: scp, ftp

### Description: Remote hosts list:
#   Please enter a space-separated list of hosts (IP or FQDN) where archives will
#   be uploaded.
# d-i backup-manager/upload-hosts string <string>

### Description: SSH user's login:
#   For the scp transfer mode to be possible, a SSH account will be used. The SSH login
#   to use is required as well as the path to the private key.
#   .
#   Remote hosts must have the user's public key listed in their authorized_keys files
#   (see ssh-keygen(1) for details).
# d-i backup-manager/upload-user-scp string bmngr

### Description: FTP user's login:
#   Please enter the FTP user to use for uploading files to remote hosts.
# d-i backup-manager/upload-user-ftp string <string>

### Description: SSH private key file:
#   Despite of the ftp transfer mode, ssh doesn't require a password. The
#   authentication is based on the SSH key.
#   .
#   Don't forget to add the user's public key to the remote host's
#   authorized_keys file (see ssh-keygen(1) for details about ssh key
#   authentication).
# d-i backup-manager/upload-key string <string>

### Description: FTP user's password:
#   Enter the password of the FTP user to use for uploading files to remote
#   hosts.
# d-i backup-manager/upload-passwd password <password>

### Description: Remote host's repository:
#   Please enter where - on the remote hosts - archives should be stored.
#   .
#   If backup-manager is installed on those hosts, it is recommended to use a
#   subdirectory of its archive repository so that even uploaded archives will be purged
#   when needed.
# d-i backup-manager/upload-dir string /var/archives/uploads

### Description: CRON frequency:
#   Although backup-manager is designed to make daily archives, it can be run
#   less frequently, like once a week or even once a month.
#   .
#   Note that you can also choose not to run backup-manager at all with CRON.
# d-i backup-manager/cron_frequency select never
# Possible choices: never, daily, weekly, monthly

### Description: Owner user of the repository:
#   For security reason, the repository where archives will be stored is accessible
#   by a specific user.
#   .
#   The repository and archives inside will be readable and writeable by this user.
# d-i backup-manager/repo_user string root

### Description: Owner group of the repository:
#   For security reason, the repository where archives will be stored is accessible
#   by a specific group.
#   .
#   The repository and archives inside will be readable and writeable by this group.
# d-i backup-manager/repo_group string root

### Description: Remove deprecated file /etc/cron.d/backup-manager?
#   In previous version, backup-manager uses /etc/cron.d directory but this directory is not
#   handled by anacron. Thus, it is not possible to run backup-manager's job asynchronously, if
#   cron.d is used.
#   .
#   In order to let anacron handle backup-manager's job, the following CRON subdirectories are used:
#   /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly, depending on the chosen frequency.
#   .
#   As jobs handled by the cron.d subdirectory may be skipped if the system is not running,
#   it is recommended to use one of those directories instead.
# d-i backup-manager/cron_d_remove_deprecated boolean false

### Description: Encrypt archives?
#   If you don't trust the physical device where you store your data, you may want
#   to be sure that your archives won't be accessible by a malicious user.
#   .
#   Backup Manager can encrypt your archives with GPG, that means that you will
#   need a GPG identity to use that feature.
# d-i backup-manager/enable_encryption boolean false

### Description: GPG recipient:
#   You have to set the recipient for which the archive is encrypted. A valid
#   specification is a short or long key id, or a descriptive name, as explained
#   in the gpg man page.
#   .
#   The public key for this identity must be in the key ring of the user running gpg,
#   which may be root in most of the cases.
# d-i backup-manager/encryption_recipient string <string>

#### bilibop-rules_0.4.23_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Do you intend to install bilibop-rules on a Live System ?
#   Some bilibop-rules settings can be useful on non-volatile Operating Systems,
#   when running from a removable and writable media (USB sticks, external HDD
#   or SD cards); but they are currently useless or even harmful for LiveCD or
#   LiveUSB systems.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, no other question will be asked; bilibop udev
#   rules will be applied but nothing else will be modified on your system.
#   Note that in that case, this package is overkill and you should probably
#   replace it by the lighter but as much as efficient bilibop-udev package.
# d-i bilibop-rules/on-live-system boolean false

### Description: Do you want to use custom bilibop rules and build them now ?
#   If tens of removable media are plugged on the computer your system boots
#   from, bilibop udev rules can significantly increase boot time. This can be
#   avoided by using custom udev rules, which are specific to the device your
#   system is installed on.
#   .
#   That said, if this device can boot from different hardware port types (as
#   USB/Firewire, USB/eSATA, USB/MMC/SD, etc.), you should check the resulting
#   rules by booting your system on the alternative port type, and if necessary
#   by running 'dpkg-reconfigure bilibop-rules' again with proper options, or
#   even by editing '/etc/udev/rules.d/66-bilibop.rules'.
# d-i bilibop-rules/bilibop_rules_generator/customize boolean false

### Description: What do you want to do with your custom rules ?
#   The file '/etc/udev/rules.d/66-bilibop.rules' exists. It is specific to the
#   drive on which your system is installed and overrides the one, more generic,
#   that is provided by the bilibop-rules package (in '/lib/udev/rules.d').
#   .
#   If the device hosting the running system is able to boot from different
#   hardware port types (USB/Firewire, USB/eSATA, USB/MMC/SD-card, etc.), you
#   should boot it from the alternative port type and check if your custom rules
#   work fine in all cases. In the doubt, you should remove the custom rules
#   file.
# d-i bilibop-rules/bilibop_rules_generator/overwrite select keep
# Possible choices: keep existing custom rules, rebuild custom rules, remove custom rules

### Description: Options to pass to the bilibop rules generator:
#   Possible options you can pass to the bilibop rules generator are the
#   followings:
#   .
#    -a vendor,model
#    -a manufacturer,product,serial
#    -e ID_VENDOR,ID_MODEL,ID_SERIAL_SHORT
#    -e ID_SERIAL
#   .
#   The two first ones cannot be mixed; for example, '-a model,serial' is not a
#   valid option; use '-a model -e ID_SERIAL' instead. In the doubt, you should
#   probably set it to an empty string (defaults to
#   '-a manufacturer,product,serial').
# d-i bilibop-rules/bilibop_rules_generator/options string <string>

### Description: What kind of GRUB device map do you want to use ?
#   The '/boot/grub/device.map' file can store obsolete information. In some cases,
#   this can lead to failures when the GRUB bootloader menu is updated. To avoid
#   that, it is possible to replace the device map by a fake one, mapping only
#   the physical drive hosting your system; or by a link to a temporary file,
#   which may be created either at boot time with a fake content, or on demand
#   with an updated content.
#   .
#   If your external system is embedded on a device able to boot from different
#   hardware port types (USB/Firewire, USB/eSATA, USB/MMC/SD, etc.), it is not
#   recommended to use a static device map. The dynamic fake device map should
#   work in all cases.
# d-i bilibop-rules/grub_device_map_manager select keep
# Possible choices: the existing one, a static device map (not recommended), a static fake device map, a dynamic fake device map, a dynamically updated device map

### Description: What persistent rules do you want to make unpersistent ?
#   Some udev rules files can store information about components of the computer
#   your system is plugged on:
#   .
#    /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules
#    /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
#   .
#   These files are cumulative and can store obsolete information, possibly
#   leading to unexpected behaviour of your network manager or CD burner
#   application. It is possible to replace them by symlinks to temporary files
#   to keep them always up to date. Note that it is possible to do or undo that
#   at any time by running
#   .
#    dpkg-reconfigure bilibop-rules
# d-i bilibop-rules/make_unpersistent_rules select keep
# Possible choices: keep them in their current state, make unpersistent cd rules only, make unpersistent net rules only, make unpersistent rules for all (recommended), make persistent rules for all

### Description: Do you want to hide Physical Volumes your system does not need ?
#   It seems that the drive on which your system is installed contains Logical
#   Volumes. It is possible to set LVM to activate only the Physical Volumes
#   that your system needs. This can mainly avoid name conflicts between the
#   Volumes used by your system and those that could be found on internal or
#   external drives plugged on the same computer.
#   .
#   If you choose to use this feature, this will overwrite '/etc/lvm/lvm.conf',
#   and you should read 'README.Debian' in the documentation of the package.
#   Otherwise, you can do it later with
#   .
#    dpkg-reconfigure -p low bilibop-rules
# d-i bilibop-rules/physical_volumes_filter/system-only boolean false

### Description: for internal use only
# d-i bilibop-rules/physical_volumes_filter/filter string <string>

### Description: HTTP proxy information (leave blank for none):
#   If you need to use an HTTP proxy to access the outside world, enter the
#   proxy information here. Otherwise, leave this blank.
#   .
#   Please use URL syntax ("http://host[:port]") here.
# d-i clamav-freshclam/http_proxy string <string>

### Description: Proxy user information (leave blank for none):
#   If you need to supply a username and password to the proxy, enter it here.
#   Otherwise, leave this blank.
#   .
#   When entering user information, use the standard form of
#   "user:pass".
# d-i clamav-freshclam/proxy_user string <string>

### Description: Number of freshclam updates per day:
# d-i clamav-freshclam/update_interval string 24

### Description: Network interface connected to the Internet:
#   Please enter the name of the network interface connected to the Internet.
#   Example: eth0.
#   .
#   If the daemon runs when the network is down, the log file will be filled
#   with entries like 'ERROR: Connection with database.clamav.net failed.',
#   making it easy to miss when freshclam really can't update the database.
#   .
#   You can leave this field blank and the daemon will be started from
#   the initialization scripts instead. You should then make sure the computer is
#   permanently connected to the Internet to avoid filling the log files.
#   .
#   If the computer has multiple network interfaces connecting to the Internet use
#   a space-separated list of device names.
# d-i clamav-freshclam/internet_interface string <string>

### Description: Should clamd be notified after updates?
#   Please confirm whether clamd should be notified to reload the database after
#   successful updates.
#   .
#   If you do not choose this option, clamd's database reloads will be notably
#   delayed (it performs this check every 6 hours by default), posing the risk
#   that a new virus may slip through even if the database is up to date.
#   Do not use this if you do not use clamd, as it will produce errors.
# d-i clamav-freshclam/NotifyClamd boolean true

### Description: Do you want to enable support for Google Safe Browsing?
#   When activated for the first time, freshclam will download a new database
#   file (safebrowsing.cvd) which will be automatically loaded by clamd and
#   clamscan during the next reload, provided that the heuristic phishing
#   detection is turned on. This database includes information about websites
#   that may be phishing sites or possible sources of malware. When using this
#   option, it's mandatory to run freshclam at least every 30 minutes.
#   Freshclam uses the ClamAV's mirror infrastructure to distribute the
#   database and its updates but all the contents are provided under Google's
#   terms of use.
# d-i clamav-freshclam/SafeBrowsing boolean false

### Description: Do you want to download the bytecode database?
# d-i clamav-freshclam/Bytecode boolean true

### Description: Private mirror for freshclam:
#   This option allows you to easily point freshclam to private mirrors.
#   If PrivateMirror is set, freshclam does not attempt to use DNS
#   to determine whether its databases are out-of-date, instead it will
#   use the If-Modified-Since request or directly check the headers of the
#   remote database files. For each database, freshclam first attempts
#   to download the CLD file. If that fails, it tries to download the
#   CVD file. This option overrides DatabaseMirror, DNSDatabaseInfo
#   and ScriptedUpdates. It can be used multiple times to provide
#   fall-back mirrors.
# d-i clamav-freshclam/PrivateMirror string 

### Description: Do you want to enable log rotation?
# d-i clamav-freshclam/LogRotate boolean true

#      address, and the "port" is only required for IPv6 addresses,
#      defaulting to 3310 otherwise.
#   .
#   You may specify multiple choices, separated by spaces. In such case, the
#   clamd servers will be selected in a round-robin fashion.
# d-i clamav-milter/ClamdSocket string unix:/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl

### Description: Hosts excluded from scanning:
#   Please specify, in CIDR notation (host(name)/mask), the hosts for
#   which no scanning should be performed on incoming mail. Multiple entries
#   should be separated by spaces. The "local" shortcut can be used to
#   specify locally-originated (non-SMTP) email.
#   .
#   If this field is left empty, all incoming mail will be scanned.

### Description: Mail addresses whitelist:
#   Please specify the path to a whitelist file, listing email addresses
#   that should cause scanning to be bypassed.
#   .
#   Each line in this file should be a POSIX regular expression; lines
#   starting with "#", ":" or "!" will be ignored as comments.
#   .
#   Lines may start with "From:" (with no space after the colon) to make
#   the whitelisting apply to matching sender addresses; otherwise, or
#   with a "To:" prefix, it affects recipient addresses.
# d-i clamav-milter/Whitelist string <string>

### Description: Action to perform on infected messages:
#   Please choose the action to perform on "infected" messages:
#   .
#    - Accept    : accept the message for delivery;
#    - Reject    : immediately refuse delivery (with a 5xx error);
#    - Defer     : return a temporary failure message (4xx);
#    - Blackhole : accept the message then drop it;
#    - Quarantine: accept the message then quarantine it. With
#                  Sendmail, the quarantine queue can be examined
#                  with "mailq -qQ". With Postfix, such mails are placed

# Possible choices: Off, Basic, Full

### Description: Information to log if no threat is found:
#   Please choose the level of information that will be logged when no threat is
#   found in a scanned message (this is useful in debugging but drastically
#   increases the log size):
#    - Off  : no logging;
#    - Basic: minimal information;
#    - Full : verbose information.
# d-i clamav-milter/LogClean select Off

### Description: Do you want clamav-milter to support multiple recipients?
#   This option affects the behaviour of LogInfected, LogClean and VirusAction
#   when a message with multiple recipients is scanned:
#   If SupportMultipleRecipients is off (the default)
#   then one single log entry is generated for the message and, in case the
#   message is determined to be malicious, the command indicated by VirusAction
#   is executed just once. In both cases only the last recipient is reported.
#   If SupportMultipleRecipients is on:
#   then one line is logged for each recipient and the command indicated
#   by VirusAction is also executed once for each recipient.
#   .
#   Note: although it's probably a good idea to enable this option, the default value
#   is currently set to off for legacy reasons.
# d-i clamav-milter/SupportMultipleRecipients boolean false

#### clamsmtp_1.10-13_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Add a clamsmtp system user and group?
#   New installations of clamsmtp install with a system user and group of
#   "clamsmtp".  The "clamav" user is added to the clamsmtp group to
#   allow the clamav-daemon process to view the quarantine directory.  If
#   this option is set, the installation process will also update the ownership
#   and permissions of the quarantine and run directories.
# d-i clamsmtp/addusergroup boolean true

### Description: Fix directory permissions?
#   clamsmtpd needs read and write permissions to the virus spool directory,
#   and the run directory in which its PID file is created.  Additionally, the
#   Clam AV daemon must have read access to the spool directory to scan for
#   viruses.
#   .
#   The post-installation script can fix the permissions and ownership of these
#   two directories.  It will consult the /etc/clamsmtpd.conf and
#   /etc/default/clamsmtp files for the administratively assigned TempDirectory,
#   PidFile, User, and Group variables, and then update the two directories
#   appropriately.
#   .
#   Be sure to check directory permissions after running the init script with the
#   parameters 'start' or 'restart'.
# d-i clamsmtp/do-fixperms boolean false

### Description: Purge spool directory on --purge?
#   The virus spool directory may contain quarantined viruses that can be removed
#   automatically when purging the package.

#### htcondor_8.2.3~dfsg.1-6_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Manage initial HTCondor configuration automatically?
#   The setup for HTCondor can be handled automatically, asking a few questions
#   to create an initial configuration appropriate for a machine that is either
#   a member of an existing pool or a fully functional "Personal HTCondor
#   installation". This generated initial configuration can be further extended
#   later on.
#   .
#   Otherwise, HTCondor will be installed with a default configuration that needs
#   to be customized manually.
# d-i condor/wantdebconf boolean false

### Description: Enable submission of usage statistics?
#   The HTCondor authors politely request that each HTCondor pool sends them periodic
#   updates with basic information about the status of the pool. Updates include
#   only the total number of machines, the number of jobs submitted, the number
#   of machines running jobs, the host name of the central manager, and the name
#   of the pool. These updates help the HTCondor Team see how HTCondor is being used
#   around the world.
# d-i condor/phonehome boolean false

### Description: Address of the central manager:
#   If this machine is intended to join an existing HTCondor pool, the address of the
#   central manager machine has to be specified. Any address format supported
#   by HTCondor can be used, including macro expressions.
#   .
#   Example: condor-manager.example.org
# d-i condor/centralmanager string <string>

### Description: Role of this machine in the HTCondor pool:
#   Please specify the intended role or roles of this machine, for which the
#   corresponding daemons will be started automatically.
#   .
#   A machine in a HTCondor pool can have multiple roles. In general there is one
#   central manager and multiple nodes that run jobs. Often the central manager
#   is also the machine from which users submit jobs. However, it is also
#   possible to have multiple machines available for job submission.
# d-i condor/daemons multiselect SCHEDD, STARTD
# Possible choices: Job submission, Job execution, Central manager

### Description: Email address of the local HTCondor administrator:
#   The HTCondor administrator will receive error messages if something goes wrong
#   with HTCondor on this machine.
# d-i condor/admin string root@localhost

### Description: user directory domain label:
#   This label is a string that HTCondor uses to decide if a submitting
#   machine and an execute machine share the same directory of user accounts
#   (that is, whether UID 1000 on one machine is the same person as UID 1000
#   on the other). If the labels on the two machines match, HTCondor will run
#   each job under the UID that submitted the job, and send emails about
#   them to user@DOMAIN (using this label as the value of DOMAIN). If not,
#   HTCondor will run all jobs as user "nobody". Leaving it blank will cause
#   HTCondor to run all jobs on this machine as user "nobody".
#   .
#   Any domain format supported by HTCondor can be used, including macro
#   expressions. Example: $(FULL_HOSTNAME)
# d-i condor/uiddomain string <string>

### Description: File system domain label:
#   This label is an arbitrary string that is used to decide if a submitting
#   machine and an execute machine share the same file system. In a dedicated
#   cluster all machines will most likely use a shared file system and hence
#   should use the same label. If left blank, it will automatically be set to
#   the fully qualified hostname of the local machine, which will prevent
#   HTCondor assuming that any two machines share a file system.
#   .
#   Example: my_shared_volume
# d-i condor/filesystemdomain string <string>

### Description: Perform a "Personal HTCondor installation"?
#   A Personal HTCondor installation is a fully functional HTCondor pool on a single
#   machine. HTCondor will automatically configure and advertise as many slots as
#   it detects CPU cores on this machine. HTCondor daemons will not be available
#   through external network interfaces.
#   .
#   This configuration is not appropriate if this machine is intended to be a
#   member of a pool.
# d-i condor/personal boolean true

### Description: Amount of physical memory to withhold from HTCondor (in MB):
#   By default, HTCondor considers all the physical memory of a machine as
#   available to be used by HTCondor jobs. If this value is defined,
#   HTCondor subtracts it from the amount of memory it advertises as available.
#   .
#   Example (to reserve 1 GB): 1024
# d-i condor/reservedmemory string <string>

### Description: Machines with write access to this host:
#   All machines that are to participate in the HTCondor pool need to be listed
#   here. This setting can be a plain comma-separated list, a domain with
#   wildcards, or a macro expression. By default only localhost is allowed to
#   access HTCondor daemons on this machine.
#   .
#   Example: *.condor-pool.example.org
# d-i condor/allowwrite string <string>

### Description: Run HTCondor jobs regardless of other machine activity?
#   By default HTCondor only starts jobs when a machine is idle, i.e. no keyboard
#   activity or CPU load for some time. Moreover, it also suspends jobs whenever
#   there is console activity and doesn't continue them until the machine becomes
#   idle again. However, for a dedicated compute node or a Personal HTCondor
#   installation it might be desirable to always start jobs as soon as they are
#   submitted (given that resources are still available), and to run them
#   continuously regardless of other activity on this machine.
#   .
#   If you plan to compose a custom policy it is best to keep HTCondor's default
#   here.
# d-i condor/startpolicy boolean false

### Description: Method for toggling between national and Latin mode:
#   You will need a way to toggle the keyboard between the national
#   layout and the standard Latin layout.
#   .
#   Right Alt or Caps Lock keys are often chosen for ergonomic reasons
#   (in the latter case, use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps
#   toggle). Alt+Shift is also a popular combination; it will
#   however lose its usual behavior in Emacs and other programs
#   that use it for specific needs.
#   .
#   Not all listed keys are present on all keyboards.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/toggle select Alt+Shift
# Possible choices: Caps Lock, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Shift, Right Logo key, Menu key, Alt+Shift, Control+Shift, Control+Alt, Alt+Caps Lock, Left Control+Left Shift, Left Alt, Left Control, Left Shift, Left Logo key, Scroll Lock key, No toggling

### Description: Method for temporarily toggling between national and Latin input:
#   When the keyboard is in national mode and one wants to type only a few
#   Latin letters, it might be more appropriate to switch temporarily to
#   Latin mode. The keyboard remains in that mode as long as the chosen key is
#   kept pressed. That key may also be used to input national letters when
#   the keyboard is in Latin mode.
#   .
#   You can disable this feature by choosing "No temporary switch".
# d-i keyboard-configuration/switch select No temporary switch
# Possible choices: No temporary switch, Both Logo keys, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Logo key, Left Alt, Left Logo key

### Description: Key to function as AltGr:
#   With some keyboard layouts, AltGr is a modifier key used to input
#   some characters, primarily ones that are unusual for the language of the
#   keyboard layout, such as foreign currency symbols and accented letters.
#   These are often printed as an extra symbol on keys.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/altgr select Right Alt (AltGr)
# Possible choices: The default for the keyboard layout, No AltGr key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Alt, Left Logo key, Keypad Enter key, Both Logo keys, Both Alt keys

### Description: Compose key:
#   The Compose key (known also as Multi_key) causes the computer to interpret
#   the next few keystrokes as a combination in order to produce a character
#   not found on the keyboard.
#   .
#   On the text console the Compose key does not work in Unicode mode. If not
#   in Unicode mode, regardless of what you choose here, you can always also
#   use the Control+period combination as a Compose key.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/compose select No compose key
# Possible choices: No compose key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Logo key, Caps Lock

### Description: Use Control+Alt+Backspace to terminate the X server?
#   By default the combination Control+Alt+Backspace does nothing.  If
#   you want it can be used to terminate the X server.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/ctrl_alt_bksp boolean false

#   The courier-pcp package is required to use the groupware mode.
#   .
#   Local mode adds very little overhead over a disabled calendaring

#   .
#   If the mail system on this machine depends on crm114, it is highly
#   recommended that delivery (or just crm114 processing) should be temporarily

### Description: Do you want CUPS to print unknown jobs as raw jobs?
#   The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) enforces a MIME type for all
#   print jobs. Since not all sources of print jobs can attach an
#   appropriate type, many jobs get submitted as the MIME type
#   application/octet-stream and could be rejected if CUPS cannot guess
#   the job's format.
#   .
#   CUPS can handle all such jobs as "raw" jobs, which causes them to be
#   sent directly to the printer without processing.
#   .
#   It is recommended to choose this option if the server will be
#   accepting print jobs from Windows computers or Samba servers.
# d-i cupsys/raw-print boolean true

### Description: Printer communication backends:
#   CUPS uses backend programs to communicate with the printer device or port.
#   .
#   Unfortunately, some backend programs are likely to cause some trouble.
#   For example, some PPC kernels crash with the parallel backend.
#   .
#   Please choose the backend program to be used by CUPS. The default choice

#   'none' no chroot jail will be created and used.
#   A chroot file hierarchy will be created in the specified location.
# d-i cvsd/rootjail string /var/lib/cvsd

### Description: The maximum number of connections that can be handled:
#   It is possible to specify a maximum number of connections that cvsd
#   can handle simultaneously. Specifying 0 (zero) will put no limit to
#   the number of connections.
# d-i cvsd/maxconnections string 10

### Description: Nice value cvsd should run at:
#   cvsd can be run at reduced priority so it will not take up too
#   many resources, especially if a user specifies a -z option to cvs.
#   The priority can also be increased (negative value here).
# d-i cvsd/nice string 1

### Description: Umask cvsd should run at:
#   Specify the umask cvsd and cvs should use when creating files.
#   .
#   The umask should be specified as an octal value and represents
#   the permissions that should be taken away when creating a file
#   (e.g. using 027 will create files with mode 640 or rw-r-----).
# d-i cvsd/umask string 027

### Description: Address and port on which cvsd will listen:
#   With the first argument you can specify the address cvsd should listen on.
#   The '*' address specifies that cvsd should listen on all addresses.
#   You can specify a IPv4 address, IPv6 address, a hostname or '*'.
#   .
#   The second argument is the service name (e.g. cvspserver) or port number
#   (default 2401) cvsd will listen on.
#   .
#   The address and port should be separated by a space and you can specify multiple
#   address-port combinations by separating them with spaces.
# d-i cvsd/listen string * 2401

### Description: Repositories to serve:
#   The whole idea of cvsd is to serve repositories. Specify a colon ':'
#   separated list of repositories to serve. The location of these repositories
#   is relative to the specified chroot jail (${rootjail}) and should start with a '/'.
#   .
#   The repositories here should be initialized by hand with something like
#   'cvs -d ${rootjail}/myrepos init' after which passwords can be set with

### Description: Resources of pserver processes to limit:
#   The pserver wrapper can be configured to limit the resource usage that
#   a pserver process can have. These resource limits will be set on each
#   pserver process and not on the wrapper.
#   .
#   Choose from the list the resources that you want to limit.
#   You will be asked to specify limits about every resource you selected here.
#   .
#   Note that not all resources may be available on all systems and that
#   resources may be system and kernel specific so use these with caution.
#   The results of exceeding the set limits may also be system specific
#   but will most likely stop the cvs process and close the connection
#   (may be problematic with write access to cvs repository).
# d-i cvsd/limits multiselect <choice(s)>
# Possible choices: coredumpsize, cputime, datasize, filesize, memorylocked, openfiles, maxproc, memoryuse, stacksize, virtmem

### Description: Maximum file size of a core dump:
#   Set this to 0 (zero) (should be the system default) to prevent core dumps.
#   Otherwise this limits the size of core dumps to the specified value.

#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_datasize string 10m

### Description: Maximum size of files created:
#   This limits the maximum size of a file created by cvs.
#   Note that the cvs pserver process needs to be able to create
#   lock files and possibly write history or other files so
#   don't set this to 0 (zero).
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_filesize string 1m

### Description: Maximum amount of locked memory:
#   This limits the amount of memory the cvs process may lock.
#   cvs probably doesn't need to lock any memory at all.
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_memorylocked string 10m

### Description: Maximum number of open files:
#   This limits the number of files and connections that the cvs
#   process can have open at a single moment. The cvs process needs
#   to access quite a few files so don't set this too low.
# d-i cvsd/limit_openfiles string 1024

### Description: Maximum number of processes:
#   This limits the maximum number of processes that a single user may have.
#   cvs may need to spawn additional processes to run scripts or do subtasks
#   so don't set this too low.
# d-i cvsd/limit_maxproc string 20

### Description: Maximum size of resident memory:
#   This specifies the amount of physical memory a process may have.
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'

# d-i cvsd/limit_stacksize string 10m

### Description: Maximum amount of virtual memory allocated:
#   This limits the total amount of virtual memory a process may have allocated.
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_virtmem string 10m

### Description: Maximum number of threads:
#   This limits the number of threads that a single process may have.
#   .
#   This is not available under Linux so it is not in the list
#   for cvsd/limits. If Hurd has it it may be useful.
# d-i cvsd/limit_pthreads string 20

### Description: Remove chroot jail containing repositories?
#   The following directory is configured as a chroot jail for cvsd:
#     ${rootjail}
#   You may choose to remove the chroot jail but you will also lose all the
#   repositories inside the chroot jail. If you have not backed up your
#   repositories you want to keep do not remove it now and manually remove
#   it later once your repositories are safe.
#   .
#   If you do choose to remove the chroot directory, all directories under
#   it will be removed, even if they are on another file system.
#   .
#   If you choose to keep the chroot jail please note that the cvsd user and

#   system.  These of course may change with each upgrade.  This package can
#   attempt to automatically keep track of your installed gcc and cpp versions
#   and reconfigure cxref-cpp accordingly, or it can leave such configuration
#   up to you.  In the latter case, you can run /usr/bin/cxref-cpp-configure
#   as root whenever you wish, and/or you can edit the file
#   /etc/cxref/cxref-cpp.defines by hand.  In the former case, the defines
#   file will be automatically updated every time the cxref package is

#   .
#   If you confirm the upgrade, the database file
#   /var/lib/darkstat/darkstat.db will be removed (because it will prevent
#   darkstat starting). A new database file will be created from scratch when
#   darkstat restarts.
#   .
#   If you don't confirm the upgrade, the package will be left non-configured,
#   and if you wish to use an older version of darkstat you will have to
#   downgrade manually.

### Description: Will this server be used to access remote databases?
#   For the database types that support it, dbconfig-common includes support
#   for configuring databases on remote systems.  When installing a package's
#   database via dbconfig-common, the questions related to remote
#   configuration are asked with a priority such that they are
#   skipped for most systems.
#   .
#   If you select this option, the default behavior will be to prompt you
#   with questions related to remote database configuration when you install
#   new packages.
#   .
#   If you are unsure, you should not select this option.
# d-i dbconfig-common/remote-questions-default boolean false

### Description: Keep "administrative" database passwords?
#   By default, you will be prompted for all administrator-level database
#   passwords when you configure, upgrade, or remove applications with
#   dbconfig-common.  These passwords will not be stored in the
#   configuration database (debconf) for
#   any longer than they are needed.
#   .
#   This behavior can be disabled, in which case the passwords will
#   remain in the database.  That
#   database is protected by Unix file permissions, though this is
#   less secure and thus not the default setting.
#   .
#   If you would rather not be bothered for an administrative password
#   every time you upgrade a database application with dbconfig-common,
#   you should choose this option.  Otherwise, you should refuse this option.
# d-i dbconfig-common/remember-admin-pass boolean false

### Description: Configure database for ${pkg} with dbconfig-common?
#   The ${pkg} package must have a database installed and configured before

#   dbconfig-common.
#   .
#   If you are an advanced database administrator and know that you want
#   to perform this configuration manually, or if your database has already
#   been installed and configured, you should refuse this option.  Details on what
#   needs to be done should most likely be provided in /usr/share/doc/${pkg}.

#   Otherwise, you should probably choose this option.
# d-i dbconfig-common/dbconfig-install boolean true

### Description: Reinstall database for ${pkg}?
#   Since you are reconfiguring ${pkg}, you may also want to reinstall the
#   database which it uses.
#   .
#   If you wish to reinstall the database for ${pkg}, you should select
#   this option.  If you do not wish to do so (if you are reconfiguring
#   the package for unrelated reasons), you should not select this option.
# d-i dbconfig-common/dbconfig-reinstall boolean false

### Description: Perform upgrade on database for ${pkg} with dbconfig-common?
#   According to the maintainer for this package, database upgrade
#   operations need to be performed on ${pkg}.  Typically, this is due to
#   changes in how a new upstream version of the package needs to store
#   its data.
#   .
#   If you want to handle this process manually, you should
#   refuse this option.  Otherwise, you should choose this option.
#   During the upgrade, a backup of the database will be made in
#   /var/cache/dbconfig-common/backups, from which the database can
#   be restored in the case of problems.
# d-i dbconfig-common/dbconfig-upgrade boolean true

### Description: Deconfigure database for ${pkg} with dbconfig-common?
#   Since you are removing ${pkg}, it's possible that you no longer
#   want the underlying database.

#   If you no longer have need of the data being stored by ${pkg}, you
#   should choose this option.  If you want to keep this data,
#   or if you would rather handle this process manually, you should
#   refuse this option.
# d-i dbconfig-common/purge boolean false

### Description: Do you want to back up the database for ${pkg} before upgrading?
#   The underlying database for ${pkg} needs to be upgraded as part of the
#   installation process.  Just in case, the database can be backed up
#   before this is done, so that if something goes wrong, you can revert
#   to the previous package version and repopulate the database.

### Description: Next step:
#   Configuring the database for ${pkg} requires the package ${dbpackage}
#   to be installed and configured first, which is not something that can be
#   checked for automatically.
#   .
#   If in doubt, you should choose "abort", and install ${dbpackage} before
#   continuing with the configuration of this package.  If you choose "retry",
#   you will be allowed to choose different answers (in case you chose the

#   For a standard PostgreSQL package installation,
#   a database password is not required, since authentication is done at the
#   system level.
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/admin-pass password <password>

### Description: Method for authenticating the PostgreSQL administrator:
#   PostgreSQL servers provide several different mechanisms for authenticating
#   connections.  Please select what method the administrative user should use

#   With "ident" authentication on the local machine, the
#   server will check that the owner of the unix socket is allowed to connect.
#   .
#   With "ident" authentication to remote hosts, RFC 1413 based ident is
#   used (note this can be considered a security risk).
#   .
#   With "password" authentication, a password will be passed to the server
#   for use with some authentication backend (such as "md5" or "pam").  Note
#   that the password is still passed in the clear across network

### Description: Change PostgreSQL configuration automatically?
#   It has been determined that the database installation for ${pkg}
#   can not be automatically accomplished without making changes to
#   the PostgreSQL server's access controls.  It is suggested that this
#   be done by dbconfig-common when the package is installed.  If
#   instead you would prefer it done manually, the following line needs
#   to be added to your pg_hba.conf:

# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/changeconf boolean false

### Description: Revert PostgreSQL configuration automatically?
#   As ${pkg} is now being removed, it may no longer be necessary to
#   have an access control entry in the PostgreSQL server's configuration.
#   While keeping such an entry will not break any software on the
#   system, it may be seen as a potential security concern.  It is suggested
#   that this be done by dbconfig-common when the package is removed.
#   If instead you would prefer it done manually, the following line

#   connections.
#   .
#   You have the option of starting the distcc daemon automatically on the
#   computer startup. If in doubt, it's advised not to start it automatically
#   on startup. If you later change your mind, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure
#   distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon boolean false

### Description: Allowed client networks:
#   The distcc daemon implements access control based on the IP address of the
#   client, that is trying to connect. Only the hosts or networks listed
#   here are allowed to connect.
#   .
#   You can list multiple hosts and/or networks, separated by spaces. Hosts are
#   represented by their IP address, networks have to be in CIDR notation,
#   f.e. "192.168.1.0/24".
#   .
#   To change the list at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-allow string 127.0.0.1

### Description: Listen interfaces:
#   The distcc daemon can be bound to a specific network interface.
#   .
#   You probably want to choose the interface of your local network by entering
#   its IP address. If distccd should listen on all interfaces, just enter
#   nothing.
#   .
#   Be sure to protect distccd from unauthorized access, by being careful in
#   your choice of the listen interface and allowed networks. distccd should 
#   never be accessible from untrusted networks. If that is needed, secureshell
#   should be used instead of the daemon.
#   .
#   To change the address at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-listen string 127.0.0.1

### Description: Nice level:
#   You can start the distcc daemon with a nice level, to give it a low priority
#   compared to other processes. The start script will only accept values between
#   0 and 20.
#   .
#   To change this value at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-nice string 10

### Description: Maximum number of concurrent jobs:
#   You can tell the distcc daemon to accept a maximum number of jobs at a time.
#   This can be useful on systems that should stay interactive while they serve
#   as a distcc server. Usually, you will want to set this to a value matching
#   or doubling the number of cores on this system.
#   .
#   To change this value at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-jobs string 

### Description: Enable Zeroconf support?
#   distcc has Zeroconf support.
#   .
#   If you enable it here, please read /usr/share/doc/distcc/README.Debian to
#   learn how clients must be configured to make use of it. Also note, that
#   you need to install the dbus package, if you're going to use Zeroconf.

#   the DECnet name is the same as the IP name (if your machine has one). If you
#   do not know the answer to this question please contact your system
#   administrator.
# d-i dnet-common/nodename string linux

### Description: DECnet node address:
#   All nodes on a DECnet network have a node address. This is two numbers
#   separated with a period (e.g. 3.45) where the first number denotes the area
#   and the second is the node within that area.
#   .
#   Do not make up a number here. If you do not know your DECnet node address
#   then ask your system administrator.
# d-i dnet-common/nodeaddr string 1.10

### Description: Configure DECnet now:
#   You can configure your system as a DECnet node now or later.
#   If you have already set up your system to use DECnet you can
#   skip this and leave the configuration as it is.
#   .
#   If you choose to configure now this will set up your system.
#   This operation needs to change the MAC address of your network cards,
#   it may work directly or it may require a reboot.
#   Please close all open connections such as ssh sessions and downloads
#   before you continue.
#   .
#   If you opt to configure later you can run this configure step again
#   with: dpkg-reconfigure dnet-common

# d-i dokuwiki/system/purgepages boolean false

### Description: Make the configuration web-writeable?
#   DokuWiki includes a web-based configuration interface. To be usable, it

#   To configure the Apache webserver (for example), the following directive
#   creates the needed directory alias:
#   .
#         Alias /durep /usr/share/durep/www
#   .
#   To install supplementary files into another root directory please specify its

#### efingerd_1.6.5_amd64.deb

### Description: Permit users to have their own configurable finger replies?
#   You can decide if efingerd honours users' ~/.efingerd files.

#   If someone from network fingers given user, and the user has ~/.efingerd
#   file readable and executable for efingerd daemon, this file will be
#   executed and its output will be sent to the fingerer.
#   .
#   This can be either desired or not, depending on your system policy. In
#   particular, allowing .efingerd files allows users to cheat about their
#   real identity. However, efingerd can be configured to display users' full
#   names (from passwd) as the first line of the reply, so they cannot hide
#   themselves completely.
#   .
#   There is however a slight security concern: if you allow .efingerd files,
#   these files will be executed under efingerd UID, so malicious users gain
#   access to all files owned by efingerd - this becomes important when you
#   make efingerd to log into some files writable by the daemon, unless you
#   take appropriate precautions.
#   .
#   If you are the only user, or you trust your users, there is no reason to
#   disable .efingerd files (and this is probably a reason you want to install
#   efingerd for). However, if you expect your users to be nasty, you should
#   better think about protecting from them - in particular, if you enable
#   logging, make sure they cannot fiddle with the logfile - this is UP TO
#   YOU.
# d-i efingerd/allow_files boolean true

### Description: Display users' real names?
#   By default, efingerd displays users real names (from passwd) as the first

#   use of .efingerd files at the same time, be aware that users can hide
#   their identity for the fingerer.

#   single, fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
#   .
#   Thus, if a mail address on the local host is foo@example.org,
#   the correct value for this option would be example.org.
#   .
#   This name won't appear on From: lines of outgoing messages if rewriting
#   is enabled.
# d-i exim4/mailname string <string>

### Description: Other destinations for which mail is accepted:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of recipient domains for
#   which this machine should consider itself the final destination.
#   These domains are commonly called 'local domains'. The local hostname
#   (${fqdn}) and 'localhost' are always added to the list given here.
#   .
#   By default all local domains will be treated identically. If both
#   a.example and b.example are local domains, acc@a.example and
#   acc@b.example will be delivered to the same final destination. If
#   different domain names should be treated differently, it is
#   necessary to edit the config files afterwards.
# d-i exim4/dc_other_hostnames string 

### Description: Domains to relay mail for:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of recipient domains for
#   which this system will relay mail, for example as a fallback MX or
#   mail gateway. This means that this system will accept mail for these
#   domains from anywhere on the Internet and deliver them according to
#   local delivery rules.
#   .
#   Do not mention local domains here. Wildcards may be used.
# d-i exim4/dc_relay_domains string 

### Description: Machines to relay mail for:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of IP address ranges for
#   which this system will unconditionally relay mail, functioning as a
#   smarthost.
#   .
#   You should use the standard address/prefix format (e.g. 194.222.242.0/24
#   or 5f03:1200:836f::/48).
#   .
#   If this system should not be a smarthost for any other host, leave
#   this list blank.
# d-i exim4/dc_relay_nets string 

### Description: Visible domain name for local users:
#   The option to hide the local mail name in outgoing mail was enabled.
#   It is therefore necessary to specify the domain name this system
#   should use for the domain part of local users' sender addresses.
# d-i exim4/dc_readhost string <string>

### Description: IP address or host name of the outgoing smarthost:
#   Please enter the IP address or the host name of a mail server that
#   this system should use as outgoing smarthost. If the smarthost only
#   accepts your mail on a port different from TCP/25, append two colons
#   and the port number (for example smarthost.example::587 or
#   192.168.254.254::2525). Colons in IPv6 addresses need to be doubled.
#   .
#   If the smarthost requires authentication, please refer to
#   the Debian-specific README files in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base for
#   notes about setting up SMTP authentication.
# d-i exim4/dc_smarthost string <string>

### Description: Root and postmaster mail recipient:
#   Mail for the 'postmaster', 'root', and other system accounts needs to
#   be redirected to the user account of the actual system administrator.
#   .
#   If this value is left empty, such mail will be saved in /var/mail/mail,
#   which is not recommended.
#   .
#   Note that postmaster's mail should be read on the system to which it is
#   directed, rather than being forwarded elsewhere, so (at least one of)
#   the users listed here should not redirect their mail off this machine.
#   A 'real-' prefix can be used to force local delivery.
#   .
#   Multiple user names need to be separated by spaces.
# d-i exim4/dc_postmaster string <string>

### Description: IP-addresses to listen on for incoming SMTP connections:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of IP addresses. The Exim SMTP
#   listener daemon will listen on all IP addresses listed here.
#   .
#   An empty value will cause Exim to listen for connections on all
#   available network interfaces.
#   .
#   If this system only receives mail directly from local services
#   (and not from other hosts), it is suggested to prohibit external
#   connections to the local Exim daemon. Such services include e-mail
#   programs (MUAs) which talk to localhost only as well as fetchmail.
#   External connections are impossible when 127.0.0.1 is entered here,
#   as this will disable listening on public network interfaces.
# d-i exim4/dc_local_interfaces string notset

### Description: Keep number of DNS-queries minimal (Dial-on-Demand)?
#   In normal mode of operation Exim does DNS lookups at startup, and when
#   receiving or delivering messages. This is for logging purposes and
#   allows keeping down the number of hard-coded values in the
#   configuration.
#   .
#   If this system does not have a DNS full service resolver available at
#   all times (for example if its Internet access is a dial-up line using
#   dial-on-demand), this might have unwanted consequences. For example,
#   starting up Exim or running the queue (even with no messages waiting)
#   might trigger a costly dial-up-event.
#   .
#   This option should be selected if this system is using Dial-on-Demand.
#   If it has always-on Internet access, this option should be disabled.
# d-i exim4/dc_minimaldns boolean false

### Description: Split configuration into small files?
#   The Debian exim4 packages can either use 'unsplit configuration', a
#   single monolithic file (/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template) or 'split
#   configuration', where the actual Exim configuration files are built
#   from about 50 smaller files in /etc/exim4/conf.d/.
#   .
#   Unsplit configuration is better suited for large modifications and is
#   generally more stable, whereas split configuration offers a comfortable
#   way to make smaller modifications but is more fragile and might break
#   if modified carelessly.
#   .
#   A more detailed discussion of split and unsplit configuration can be
#   found in the Debian-specific README files in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base.
# d-i exim4/use_split_config boolean <choice>

### Description: Hide local mail name in outgoing mail?
#   The headers of outgoing mail can be rewritten to make it appear to have been
#   generated on a different system. If this option is chosen,
#   '${mailname}', 'localhost' and '${dc_other_hostnames}' in From, Reply-To,
#   Sender and Return-Path are rewritten.
# d-i exim4/hide_mailname boolean <choice>

### Description: Delivery method for local mail:
#   Exim is able to store locally delivered email in different formats.
#   The most commonly used ones are mbox and Maildir. mbox uses a single
#   file for the complete mail folder stored in /var/mail/. With Maildir
#   format every single message is stored in a separate file in ~/Maildir/.
#   .
#   Please note that most mail tools in Debian expect the local delivery
#   method to be mbox in their default.
# d-i exim4/dc_localdelivery select mbox format in /var/mail/
# Possible choices: mbox format in /var/mail/, Maildir format in home directory

#   If you accept here, the package will create init.d runlevel
#   symlinks to FIAIF. This allows FIAIF to be started automatically at
#   every boot.
#   .
#   Note that fiaif will not start until you edited the configuration file
#   /etc/fiaif/fiaif.conf, set DONT_START to zero, and reboot. So if you
#   install fiaif for the first time, it is safe to accept here. If you
#   have already set DONT_START to zero from an earlier installation, fiaif
#   will be started after the next reboot.

#   (Master Boot Record).

#   racoon feature set. You will have to directly edit /etc/racoon/racoon.conf
#   and possibly manually set up the Security Policy Database via setkey.
#   .
#   Racoon-tool has been updated for racoon 0.8.0, and is for use in basic
#   configuration setups. It gives the benefit of managing the SPD along with the
#   IKE that strongSwan offers. IPv6, transport/tunnel mode (ESP/AH), PSK/X509
#   auth, and basic "anonymous" VPN server are supported.

### Description: Restart ircd-hybrid on each upgrade?
#   Please choose whether the ircd-hybrid daemon should be restarted
#   every time a new version of this package is installed.
#   .
#   Automatic restarts may be problematic if, for instance, the server is

#   If you reject this option, you will have to restart ircd-hybrid via
#   "service ircd-hybrid restart" when needed.
# d-i ircd-hybrid/restart_on_upgrade boolean true

### Description: Upgrade ircd-hybrid to version without cryptlink support?
#   The 8.x version of ircd-hybrid includes a change to the way secure server
#   links are implemented, which is not backwards-compatible with ircd-hybrid 7.x,
#   from which you are upgrading.
#   .
#   If you have any secure server links (cryptlinks) configured with this
#   server, you should plan to either upgrade all servers in lock-step, or
#   temporarily configure non-cryptlink server links, to ensure the continuity
#   of your IRC links.
# d-i ircd-hybrid/upgrade_secure_links_warn boolean true

### Description: Upgrade ircd-hybrid to version without compatible services?
#   The 8.x version of ircd-hybrid includes a change to the way services are

#   The recommended services daemon for Hybrid 8 is Anope, for which no
#   package is available yet, although one is planned.
# d-i ircd-hybrid/upgrade_no_services_warn boolean true

### Description: Upgrade ircd-hybrid to version without SSL support?
#   The currently installed version of this package is one with "ssl" in the

### Description: FIR chip type:
#   Note that you must have a properly built kernel module if you want to use
#   a native chip. The modules offered here can be different to the ones that
#   are available for your actual kernel. In that case you have to edit
#   /etc/modutils/irda-utils (2.4) or /etc/modprobe.d/irda-utils (2.6) by hand.

### Description: Install Kismet "setuid root"?
#   Kismet needs root privileges for some of its functions. However, running it
#   as root ("sudo kismet") is not recommended, since running all of the code

#   damage. Instead Kismet can be installed with the "setuid" bit set, which
#   will allow it to grant these privileges automatically to the processes that
#   need them, excluding the user interface and packet decoding parts.
#   .
#   Enabling this feature allows users in the "kismet" group to run Kismet
#   (and capture packets, change wireless card state, etc), so only thoroughly
#   trusted users should be granted membership of the group.
#   .
#   For more detailed information, see section 4 of the Kismet README

#    * clear: no encryption. This should be chosen when LDAP servers
#      automatically encrypt the userPassword entry;
#    * crypt: make userPassword use the same format as the flat
#      local password database. If in doubt, you should choose this option;
#    * nds: use Novell Directory Services-style updating. The old
#      password is first removed, then updated;
#    * ad: Active Directory-style. This creates a Unicode password and
#      updates the unicodePwd attribute;
#    * exop: use the OpenLDAP password change extended operation to update the

#   must be world-readable.
# d-i libpam-ldap/binddn string cn=proxyuser,dc=example,dc=net

### Description: Allow LDAP admin account to behave like local root?
#   This option will allow password utilities that use PAM to
#   change local passwords.
#   .
#   The LDAP admin account password will be stored in a separate file which will be made
#   readable to root only.
#   .
#   If /etc is mounted by NFS, this option should be disabled.
# d-i libpam-ldap/dbrootlogin boolean true

### Description: LDAP server URI:

### Description: Do you want to add the large-memory option?
#   Usually LILO loads the initrd file into the first 15MB of memory to
#   avoid a BIOS limitation with older systems (earlier than 2001 and
#   few systems until 2004).
#   .
#   With newer kernels the combination of kernel and initrd may not fit
#   into the first 15MB of memory. LILO will compute the needed size of memory
#   and will automatically use the memory above 15MB, too, if there is
#   enough physical memory.
#   .
#   If this machine has a recent BIOS without a 15MB limitation and you
#   want to use memory above 15MB for all kernels, set the 'large-memory'
#   option.
# d-i lilo/add_large_memory boolean false

### Description: Do you want to run /sbin/lilo now?
#   It was detected that it's necessary to run /sbin/lilo in order to activate
#   the new LILO configuration.
#   .
#   WARNING: This procedure will write data in your MBR and may overwrite
#   some data there. If you skip this step, you must run /sbin/lilo before
#   rebooting your computer, or your system may not boot again.
# d-i lilo/runme boolean false

### Description: Do you want to convert boot and root options?
#   Since kernel using the newer disk interface 'libata' you need the newer
#   DiskID and/or UUID in your /etc/lilo.conf for the boot and root options.
#   For the most modern systems you should use this conversion and then run

############################
#### logtool_1.2.8-8_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Manual configuration of logtool's database?
#   Logtool needs a database with regular expressions that describe logfile
#   entries that should be ignored, or considered less important. You can
#   write this database manually, or use the very flexible database in the
#   package logcheck-database for this purpose.
#   .
#   If you choose to use logcheck-database and already added values to the
#   files in /etc/logtool, these files will be replaced by symbolic links in
#   the logcheck database (although backups will be preserved). Make sure this
#   is not unwanted behaviour.
#   .
#   Reply positively to manually write a database, or negatively to use the
#   database from the package "logcheck-database".
#   .
#   Note: since logtool does not depend on this database (but instead
#   Recommends it), the default answer to this question is to manually
#   configure the database.
# d-i logtool/manual boolean true

### Description: Ignored template
#   No longer used template (although its value is read for upgrade purposes),
#   no need to translate it.
# d-i logtool/ignore-start select paranoid
# Possible choices: paranoid, server, workstation

### Description: Do you want to use the '${level}' level regular expressions?
#   The database in the logcheck-database package defines three levels:
#   paranoid, server, and workstation; and it also has a database for cracking,
#   violations, and ignored violations ('violations-ignore'). Logcheck allows you
#   to pick one of the levels, and ignores the rest.
#   .
#   Logtool, on the other hand, can use multiple databases, which either
#   specify lines that should be completely excluded from output
#   (/etc/logtool/exclude) or lines that should be given a specific color
#   (green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, brightcyan). There is also the
#   possibility to not create an exclude file, and use an 'include' style of
#   file instead; its use is not recommended. Last but not least, files that
#   are not excluded from output but that do not match any other regular
#   expression are colored red.
#   .
#   If you want to map the '${level}' level database of regular expressions to
#   one of the above specified options, then answer positively to this
#   question.
# d-i logtool/use-level boolean true

### Description: What do you want the ${level} level of regular expressions to do?
#   Please specify what you want to do with a line if it matches at least one
#   of the regular expressions in the ${level} level database. You have the
#   following options (note that regular expressions are matched on a
#   line-per-line basis):
#   .
#    * exclude: discard matching lines
#    * include: discard all but matching lines. Not recommended. Note that
#      this is mutually exclusive with 'exclude'.
#    * green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, brightcyan: give matching lines
#      the specified color.
#   .
#   Note that each option can be specified for only one of paranoid,

### Description: Make lpr, lprm and lpq setuid root?
#   For full RFC1179 compliance you need to make these programs setuid root. 
#   This is mainly so they can create a socket with a low port number. The low
#   port number may be important if you have network printers or have adjusted

# d-i lprng/setuid_tools boolean false

### Description: Start lpd (Printer Daemon) at boot?
#   Some people for various reasons do not want to start lpd. Refusing this

#   enabled, while this system has them disabled.
#   .
#   Most LSB applications will work fine with either setting, but complete
#   conformance requires shadow passwords to be enabled.
#   .
#   Generally speaking, it is considered good practice to enable shadow
#   passwords. However, there are some situations in which shadow passwords

### Description: Old queue files present
#   The directory /var/lib/mailman/qfiles contains files. It needs to be

#    - Stop new messages from coming in (at the MTA level).
#    - Start a mailman queue runner: /etc/init.d/mailman start
#    - Let it run until all messages are handled.
#      If they don't all get handled in a timely manner, look at the logs
#      to try to understand why and solve the cause.
#    - Stop it: /etc/init.d/mailman stop
#    - Retry the upgrade.
#    - Let messages come in again.
#   You can also decide to simply remove the files, which will make
#   Mailman forget about (and lose) the corresponding emails.
#   .
#   If these files correspond to shunted messages, you have to either
#   delete them or unshunt them (with /var/lib/mailman/bin/unshunt).
#   Shunted messages are messages on which Mailman has already abandoned
#   any further processing because of an error condition, but that are
#   kept for admin review. You can use /var/lib/mailman/bin/show_qfiles to
#   examine the contents of the queues.

### Description: Replace existing /etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf file?
#   The existing /etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf file currently on the system does
#   not contain a marked section for automatic configuration management.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, the existing configuration
#   file will be backed up to /etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf.debconf-backup and a

#   option, the existing configuration file will not be managed automatically,
#   and no further questions about masqmail configuration will be
#   asked.
# d-i masqmail/move_existing_nondebconf_config boolean false

### Description: Masqmail host name:
#   Please enter the name used by masqmail to identify itself to others.
#   This is most likely the machine's hostname. It is used in the SMTP
#   greetings banner and generated Message-ID fields, as well as for
#   expansion of unqualified addresses, and so on.
# d-i masqmail/host_name string 

### Description: Hosts considered local:
#   Please enter a list, separated with semicolons (;), of hosts which are
#   considered "local". Mail to these hosts will be delivered to a
#   mailbox (or Maildir or MDA) on this host.
#   .
#   You will most likely insert "localhost" as well as this host's fully
#   qualified name and short name.
#   .
#   You can also use wildcard expressions containing "*" and "?".
# d-i masqmail/local_hosts string <string>

### Description: Networks considered local:
#   Please enter a list, separated with semicolons (;), of hosts which are
#   on the local network. That is, they should be always reachable, without a
#   dialup connection. Mail to these hosts will be delivered immediately,
#   without checking for the online status.
#   .
#   You can use wildcard expressions containing "*" and "?", for
#   instance "*.yournet.local".
#   .
#   That field can be left empty if this host is the only host on the
#   network. If you do not want
#   to use Masqmail as an offline MTA and all servers likely to receive
#   outbound mail from this host are always reachable, just use "*"
#   here.
# d-i masqmail/local_nets string <string>

### Description: Interfaces for incoming connections:
#   For security reasons, Masqmail does not listen an all network
#   interfaces by default. If there are no other hosts connected to this
#   host, "localhost:25" is enough for local operation. If there are other
#   hosts that need to send SMTP mail to this host, you should add the
#   address of the relevant network interface, for instance
#   "localhost:25;192.168.1.2:25".
# d-i masqmail/listen_addresses string localhost:25

### Description: Use the system log daemon for logging?
#   Masqmail may log via the system log daemon (syslog) or use its
#   own custom logging in /var/log/masqmail/masqmail.log.
# d-i masqmail/use_syslog boolean false

### Description: Online detection method:
#   Masqmail has two methods to determine whether it is online or not:
#   "file" and "pipe".
#    - With "file", it checks for the existence of a file. If it
#      exists, the name of the connection is read from that file.
#    - With "pipe", it calls a program or script, which outputs the name
#      if online or nothing if not. The "guessnet" program is a good
#      candidate for such use.
# d-i masqmail/online_detect select file
# Possible choices: file, pipe

### Description: File used to determine the online status:
# d-i masqmail/online_file string /var/run/masqmail-route

### Description: Name of the program used to determine the online status:
#   Please choose the program to use to determine the online
#   status. This program is called with "mail" as user ID.
# d-i masqmail/online_pipe string 

### Description: Local delivery style:
#   Local mail can be delivered to a mailbox, to a mail delivery
#   agent (MDA) such as procmail
#   or to Maildir-style mailboxes in the users' home directories.
#   .
#   This choice affects the default delivery mechanism. It can be defined
#   on a per-user basis with the "mbox_users", "mda_users" and
#   "maildir_users" options.
# d-i masqmail/mbox_default select mbox
# Possible choices: mbox, mda, maildir

### Description: MDA command line (including options):
#   Please choose the path to the mail delivery agent (MDA), including
#   its arguments. You can use variable substitution here,
#   such as ${rcpt_local} for the user name.
#   .
#   Masqmail's manual page describes all available variable substitutions.
#   .
#   This question is meaningful even when choosing another option than
#   MDA delivery, in case MDA is used for a restricted set of users.
# d-i masqmail/mda string /usr/bin/procmail -Y -d ${rcpt_local}

### Description: Should alias expansion be case sensitive?
#   Masqmail uses the file /etc/aliases to redirect local addresses.
#   The search for a match in /etc/aliases can be case sensitive or not.
# d-i masqmail/alias_local_caseless boolean false

### Description: Start SMTP listening daemon?
#   Please choose whether you want Masqmail to start as an SMTP listening
#   daemon. You will need this if:
#    - there are other hosts in the local network that may want to send
#      mail via this host;
#    - you use a local mail client that sends mail via SMTP.
# d-i masqmail/init_smtp_daemon boolean true

### Description: Start SMTP queue running daemon?
#   Please choose this option if you want Masqmail to start as a queue
#   running daemon. You're very likely to need this. It is used for mail
#   that cannot delivered immediately, either because of delivery
#   failures or because the host is not online on the first attempt to send
#   a mail.
# d-i masqmail/init_queue_daemon boolean true

### Description: Interval for the queue running daemon:
#   Please choose the interval for the queue running daemon.
#   .
#   The format is "-q", followed by a numeric value and one of the letters
#   s, m, h, d, or w, for seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks,
#   respectively. For instance, "-q10m" defines a ten-minute interval
#   between runs.
#   .
#   Reasonable values are between five minutes (-q5m) and two hours (-q2h).
# d-i masqmail/queue_daemon_ival string -q10m

### Description: Start POP3 fetch daemon?
#   Please choose this option if you want Masqmail to start as a fetch
#   daemon. If you do so, it will try to fetch mail from configured POP3
#   servers, detecting the online
#   status first.
#   .
#   No matter what you choose here, you can later select whether you want to fetch
#   mail when the host becomes online.
# d-i masqmail/init_fetch_daemon boolean false

### Description: Interval for the fetch daemon:
#   Please choose the interval for the fetch daemon.
#   .
#   The format is "-go", followed by a numeric value and one of the letters
#   s, m, h, d, or w, for seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks,
#   respectively.
#   .
#   Reasonable values are between two minutes (-go2m) and two hours (-go2h).
# d-i masqmail/fetch_daemon_ival string -go5m

### Description: Flush mail queue when online?
#   Please choose whether you want Masqmail to immediately flush its mail
#   queue as soon as the host comes online. This will be done by Masqmail's
#   ip-up script
#   in /etc/ppp/ip-up or in /etc/network/if-up.d/.
# d-i masqmail/ipup_runqueue boolean true

### Description: Fetch mail when online?
#   Please choose whether you want Masqmail to immediately fetch mail
#   from POP3 servers as soon as the host comes online. This will be done
#   by Masqmail's ip-up script in /etc/ppp/ip-up or in /etc/network/if-up.d/.
# d-i masqmail/ipup_fetch boolean false

### Description: List of interfaces used for Masqmail online detection:
#   Please choose a list of network interfaces which will trigger queue
#   runs and/or fetching mails when going up. The list will be used in
#   the /etc/ppp/ip-up and /etc/network/if-up.d/ scripts, when the
#   interface goes up.
#   .
#   A reasonable choice is for instance "ppp0" for a home computer connected
#   by PPP or "ppp0 eth0" for
#   a notebook.
#   .
#   Other possible choices are "all" to listen on all network interfaces, or
#   "none" for not listening on any interface.
# d-i masqmail/ifup_ifaces string all

### Description: MD arrays needed for the root file system:
#   ${msg}
#   .
#   Please enter 'all', 'none', or a space-separated list of devices such as
#   'md0 md1' or 'md/1 md/d0' (the leading '/dev/' can be omitted).
# d-i mdadm/initrdstart string all

### Description: Start arrays not listed in mdadm.conf?
#   The specified array (${array}) is not listed in the configuration
#   file (${config}). Therefore, it cannot be started during boot, unless you
#   correct the configuration file and recreate the initial ramdisk.
#   .
#   This warning is only relevant if you need arrays to be started from the
#   initial ramdisk to be able to boot. If you use kernel autostarting, or do not
#   need any arrays to be started as early as the initial ramdisk is loaded, you
#   can simply continue. Alternatively, choose not to continue and enter 'none'
#   when prompted which arrays to start from the initial ramdisk.
# d-i mdadm/initrdstart_notinconf boolean false

### Description: Should mdadm run monthly redundancy checks of the MD arrays?
#   If the kernel supports it (versions greater than 2.6.14), mdadm can periodically check the
#   redundancy of MD arrays (RAIDs). This may be a resource-intensive process,
#   depending on the local setup, but it could help prevent rare cases of data loss.
#   Note that this is a read-only check unless errors are found; if errors are
#   found, mdadm will try to correct them, which may result in write access to
#   the media.
#   .
#   The default, if turned on, is to check on the first Sunday of every
#   month at 01:06.
# d-i mdadm/autocheck boolean true

### Description: Do you want to start the MD monitoring daemon?
#   The MD (RAID) monitor daemon sends email notifications in response to
#   important MD events (such as a disk failure).
#   .
#   Enabling this option is recommended.
# d-i mdadm/start_daemon boolean true

### Description: Recipient for email notifications:

#   stop any non-NAS-aware audio clients from using the audio device.
#   .
#   The daemon can be configured to release the audio device when it is

#   nbd-client can handle multiple concurrent connections. Please specify the
#   number of connections you'd like this configuration script to set up.
#   .
#   Note that if something has already been specified in /etc/nbd-client, the
#   current configuration will be used as defaults in these dialogs.
# d-i nbd-client/number string 0

### Description: Intended use of the network block device number ${number}:
#   The network block device can serve multiple purposes. One of the most
#   interesting is to provide swap space over the network for diskless clients,
#   but you can store a filesystem on it, or do other things with it for which
#   a block device is interesting.
#   .
#   If you intend to use the network block device as a swap device, choose
#   "swap". If you intend to use it as a filesystem, add a line to /etc/fstab,
#   give it the option "_netdev" (else init will try to mount it before it's
#   usable), and choose "filesystem". For all other purposes, choose "raw".
#   The only thing the nbd-client boot script will do then is start an
#   nbd-client process; you will have to set it up manually.
# d-i nbd-client/type select raw
# Possible choices: swap, filesystem, raw

### Description: Hostname of the server (number: ${number})?
#   Please enter the network name or IP address of the machine on which
#   the nbd-server process is running.
# d-i nbd-client/host string <string>

### Description: Port or name for nbd export (number: ${number})?
#   Please enter the TCP port number or NBD export name needed to access
#   nbd-server.
#   .
#   Versions of nbd-server of 2.9.16 or lower did not support specifying a
#   name for the NBD export. If your NBD server is of an older version, you
#   should enter the TCP port number here, and should make sure not to
#   enter any non-numeric characters in the field.
#   .
#   More recent versions of nbd-server support providing a name for an
#   export. If the data entered in this field contains any non-numeric
#   characters, then this configuration system will accept that as a name
#   and provide it to nbd-client as a name-based export rather than a
#   port-based one.
# d-i nbd-client/port string <string>

### Description: /dev entry for this nbd-client (number: ${number})?
#   Every nbd-client process needs to be associated with a /dev entry with
#   major number 43. Please enter the name of the /dev entry you want to use for
#   this nbd-client. Note that this needs to be the full path to that entry,
#   not just the last part.
#   .
#   If the /dev entry specified does not exist, it will be created with minor
#   number ${number}.
# d-i nbd-client/device string <string>

### Description: Disconnect all NBD devices on "stop"?
#   When the nbd-client init script is called to stop the nbd-client service,
#   there are two things that can be done: either it can disconnect all
#   nbd-client devices (which are assumed not to be in use), or it can
#   disconnect only those nbd-client devices that it knows about in its
#   config file.
#   .
#   The default (and the traditional behavior) is to disconnect all
#   nbd-client devices. If the root device or other critical file systems
#   are on NBD this will cause data loss and should not be accepted.
# d-i nbd-client/killall boolean true

#   Note that you can always add extra servers by adding them to
#   /etc/nbd-server/config, or by running "dpkg-reconfigure nbd-server".
# d-i nbd-server/number string 0

### Description: TCP Port for server number ${number}:
#   Please specify the TCP port this instance of nbd server will use for
#   backwards compatibility with older clients.
# d-i nbd-server/port string <string>

### Description: Name of export ${number}:
#   Please specify a name for this export.
# d-i nbd-server/name string <string>

### Description: File to export (server number ${number}):
#   Please specify a file name or block device that should be exported
#   over the network. You can export a real block device (for instance
#   "/dev/hda1"); a normal file (such as "/export/nbd/bl1"); or a
#   bunch of files all at once. For the third option, you can
#   use "%s" in the filename, which will be expanded to the
#   IP-address of the connecting client. An example would be
#   "/export/swaps/swp%s".
#   .
#   Note that it is possible to tune the way in which the IP address will
#   be substituted in the file name. See "man 5 nbd-server" for details.
# d-i nbd-server/filename string <string>

### Description: Convert old-style nbd-server configuration file?
#   A pre-2.9 nbd-server configuration file has been found on this system.
#   The current nbd-server package no longer supports this file and will
#   not work if it is kept as is.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, the system will generate a new style
#   configuration file based upon the old-style configuration file, which
#   will be removed. Otherwise, configuration questions will be asked and
#   the system will generate a new configuration file.
#   .
#   If a new-style configuration file already exists and you choose this
#   option, you will shortly see a "modified configuration file" prompt, as
#   usual.
# d-i nbd-server/convert boolean true

### Description: Support port-based exports?
#   Since version 2.9.18, nbd-server supports name-based exports, rather
#   than port-based ones. While this is generally preferable, you may have
#   to support systems running an older version of nbd-client, or might
#   need to go through a lot of trouble to update your older configurations
#   in order to migrate to name-based exports. In either of those cases,
#   you should accept this option.
#   .
#   Everyone else should leave the option at the default setting, which
#   will cause nbd-server to only support name-based exports.
# d-i nbd-server/useports boolean false

#### nethack-common_3.4.3-15_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Use setgid bit with NetHack's recover utility?
#   The "recover" program in the package nethack-common is traditionally
#   installed with the "setgid" bit set, so that all users can use it to
#   recover their own save files after a crash (with "games" group
#   privileges). This is a potential source of security problems.
#   .
#   This package includes a script that runs during system boot, invoking
#   recover on any broken save files it finds. This makes it less likely
#   that users will need to run it themselves, so the default is to install
#   recover without the special permission bits required for that.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, unprivileged users will be able to run "recover".

### Description: Would you like to start an OCFS2 cluster (O2CB) at boot time?
# d-i ocfs2-tools/init boolean false

### Description: Name of the cluster to start at boot time:
# d-i ocfs2-tools/clustername string ocfs2

### Description: O2CB heartbeat threshold:
#   The O2CB heartbeat threshold sets up the maximum time in seconds that a
#   node awaits for an I/O operation. After it, the node "fences" itself,
#   and you will probably see a crash.
#   .
#   It is calculated as the result of: (threshold - 1) x 2.
#   .
#   Its default value is 31 (60 seconds).
#   .
#   Raise it if you have slow disks and/or crashes with kernel messages
#   like:
#   .
#   o2hb_write_timeout: 164 ERROR: heartbeat write timeout to device XXXX
#   after NNNN milliseconds
# d-i ocfs2-tools/heartbeat_threshold string 31

### Description: O2CB idle timeout:
#   The O2CB idle timeout (expressed in milliseconds) is the time before
#   a network connection is considered dead.
#   .
#   Its default value is 30000 (30 seconds) and the minimum recommended value
#   is 5000 (5 seconds).
# d-i ocfs2-tools/idle_timeout string 30000

### Description: O2CB keepalive delay:
#   The O2CB keepalive delay (expressed in milliseconds) is the maximum time before
#   a keepalive packet is sent.
#   .
#   Its default value is 2000 (2 seconds) and the minimum recommended value
#   is 1000 (1 second).

#### openafs-client_1.6.9-2+deb8u7_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: DB server host names for your home cell:
#   AFS uses the file /etc/openafs/CellServDB to hold the list of servers that
#   should be contacted to find parts of a cell.  The cell you claim this
#   workstation belongs to is not in that file.  Enter the host names of the
#   database servers separated by spaces. IMPORTANT: If you are creating a new
#   cell and this machine is to be a database server in that cell, only enter
#   this machine's name; add the other servers later after they are
#   functioning. Also, do not enable the AFS client to start at boot on this
#   server until the cell is configured.  When you are ready you can edit
#   /etc/openafs/afs.conf.client to enable the client.
# d-i openafs-client/cell-info string <string>

### Description: AFS cell this workstation belongs to:
#   AFS filespace is organized into cells or administrative domains.
#   Each workstation belongs to one cell.  Usually the cell is the DNS
#   domain name of the site.
# d-i openafs-client/thiscell string <string>

### Description: Size of AFS cache in kB:
#   AFS uses an area of the disk to cache remote files for faster
#   access.  This cache will be mounted on /var/cache/openafs.  It is
#   important that the cache not overfill the partition it is located
#   on.  Often, people find it useful to dedicate a partition to their
#   AFS cache.
# d-i openafs-client/cachesize string 50000

### Description: Run Openafs client now and at boot?
#   Normally, most users who install the openafs-client package expect AFS to
#   be mounted automatically at boot.  However, if you are planning on
#   setting up a new cell or are on a laptop, you may not want it started at
#   boot time.  If you choose not to start AFS at boot, run
#   /etc/init.d/openafs-client force-start to start the client when you wish
#   to run it.
# d-i openafs-client/run-client boolean true

### Description: Look up AFS cells in DNS?
#   In order to contact an AFS cell, you need the IP addresses of the cell's
#   database servers.  Normally, this information is read from
#   /etc/openafs/CellServDB.  However, if Openafs cannot find a cell in that
#   file, it can use DNS to look for AFSDB records that contain the
#   information.
# d-i openafs-client/afsdb boolean true

### Description: Encrypt authenticated traffic with AFS fileserver?
#   AFS provides a weak form of encryption that can optionally be used between
#   a client and the fileservers.  While this encryption is weaker than DES
#   and thus is not sufficient for highly confidential data, it does provide
#   some confidentiality and is likely to make the job of a casual attacker
#   significantly more difficult.
# d-i openafs-client/crypt boolean true

### Description: Dynamically generate the contents of /afs?
#   /afs generally contains an entry for each cell that a client can talk to.
#   Traditionally, these entries were generated by servers in the client's
#   home cell.  However, OpenAFS clients can generate the contents of /afs
#   dynamically based on the contents of /etc/openafs/CellServDB and DNS.
#   .
#   If you generate /afs dynamically, you may need to create
#   /etc/openafs/CellAlias to include aliases for common cells.  (The syntax
#   of this file is one line per alias, with the cell name, a space, and then
#   the alias for that cell.)
#   .
#   The Sparse option is the same as Yes except that, rather than populating
#   /afs from /etc/openafs/CellServDB immediately, cells other than the local
#   cell will not appear until they are accessed.  Cell aliases as set in the
#   CellAlias file are shown as normal, although they may appear to be
#   dangling links until traversed.
# d-i openafs-client/dynroot select Yes
# Possible choices: Yes, Sparse, No

### Description: Use fakestat to avoid hangs when listing /afs?
#   Because AFS is a global file space, operations on the /afs directory can
#   generate significant network traffic.  If some AFS cells are unavailable
#   then looking at /afs using ls or a graphical file browser may hang your
#   machine for minutes.  AFS has an option to simulate answers to these
#   operations locally to avoid these hangs.  You want this option under most
#   circumstances.
# d-i openafs-client/fakestat boolean true

### Description: Omit OpenLDAP server configuration?
#   If you enable this option, no initial configuration or database will be
#   created for you.
# d-i slapd/no_configuration boolean false

### Description: Dump databases to file on upgrade:
#   Before upgrading to a new version of the OpenLDAP server, the data from
#   your LDAP directories can be dumped into plain text files in the
#   standard LDAP Data Interchange Format.
#   .
#   Selecting "always" will cause the databases to be dumped
#   unconditionally before an upgrade. Selecting "when needed" will only
#   dump the database if the new version is incompatible with the old
#   database format and it needs to be reimported. If you select "never",
#   no dump will be done.
# d-i slapd/dump_database select when needed
# Possible choices: always, when needed, never

### Description: Directory to use for dumped databases:
#   Please specify the directory where the LDAP databases will be exported.
#   In this directory, several LDIF files will be created which correspond
#   to the search bases located on the server. Make sure you have enough
#   free space on the partition where the directory is located. The first
#   occurrence of the string "VERSION" is replaced with the server version
#   you are upgrading from.
# d-i slapd/dump_database_destdir string /var/backups/slapd-VERSION

### Description: Move old database?
#   There are still files in /var/lib/ldap which will probably break
#   the configuration process. If you enable this option, the maintainer
#   scripts will move the old database files out of the way before
#   creating a new database.
# d-i slapd/move_old_database boolean true

### Description: Retry configuration?
#   The configuration you entered is invalid. Make sure that the DNS domain name
#   is syntactically valid, the field for the organization is not left empty and
#   the admin passwords match. If you decide not to retry the configuration the
#   LDAP server will not be set up. Run 'dpkg-reconfigure slapd' if you want to
#   retry later.
# d-i slapd/invalid_config boolean true

### Description: DNS domain name:
#   The DNS domain name is used to construct the base DN of the LDAP directory.
#   For example, 'foo.example.org' will create the directory with
#   'dc=foo, dc=example, dc=org' as base DN.
# d-i slapd/domain string <string>

### Description: Organization name:
#   Please enter the name of the organization to use in the base DN of your

# d-i slapd/internal/adminpw password <password>

### Description: Generated admin password:
#   Internal template, should never be displayed to users.
# d-i slapd/internal/generated_adminpw password <password>

### Description: Allow LDAPv2 protocol?
#   The obsolete LDAPv2 protocol is disabled by default in slapd. Programs
#   and users should upgrade to LDAPv3.  If you have old programs which
#   can't use LDAPv3, you should select this option and 'allow bind_v2'
#   will be added to your slapd.conf file.
# d-i slapd/allow_ldap_v2 boolean false

### Description: Database backend to use:
#   HDB and BDB use similar storage formats, but HDB adds support for
#   subtree renames. Both support the same configuration options.
#   .
#   The MDB backend is recommended. MDB uses a new storage format and
#   requires less configuration than BDB or HDB.
#   .
#   In any case, you should review the resulting database configuration for
#   your needs. See /usr/share/doc/slapd/README.Debian.gz for more details.

#### openssh-server_6.7p1-5+deb8u4_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Disable SSH password authentication for root?
#   Previous versions of openssh-server permitted logging in as root over SSH
#   using password authentication. The default for new installations is now
#   "PermitRootLogin without-password", which disables password authentication
#   for root without breaking systems that have explicitly configured SSH
#   public key authentication for root.
#   .
#   This change makes systems more secure against brute-force password
#   dictionary attacks on the root user (a very common target for such
#   attacks). However, it may break systems that are set up with the
#   expectation of being able to SSH as root using password authentication. You
#   should only make this change if you do not need to do that.

### Description: Would you like debconf to create magicfilter filters?
#   Magicfilter is a customizable, extensible automatic printer filter. It

#   black-and-white printing.
#   .
#   The template filter is found in /usr/share/pnm2ppa/ as
#   "pnm2ppa-magicfilter.in".  update-magicfilter uses sed to replace
#   @OPTIONS@ from the template and place the resulting filters in
#   /etc/magicfilter.  Additionally, symbolic links are created from the
#   generated pnm2ppa filters to pbm2ppa filters (the deprecated

### Description: Enable SSL by default in new PostgreSQL clusters?
#   PostgreSQL supports SSL-encrypted connections. This is usually a good thing.
#   However, if the database is solely accessed using TCP connections on
#   localhost, SSL can be turned off without introducing security issues.
#   .
#   UNIX domain socket connections (called "local" in pg_hba.conf) are not
#   affected by this setting. This setting concerns new PostgreSQL clusters
#   created during package install, or by using the pg_createcluster command. It

### Description: Run proftpd:
#   ProFTPD can be run either as a service from inetd, or as a standalone
#   server. Each choice has its own benefits. With only a few FTP
#   connections per day, it is probably better to run ProFTPD from inetd in

### Description: Run pure-ftpd from inetd or as a standalone server:
#   Pure-ftpd can be run from inetd or as a standalone daemon. Using inetd is
#   a suitable option for small ftp servers because the inetd super-server
#   will only launch pure-ftpd to handle incoming connections. Standalone
#   operation is more efficient for busy ftp sites.
#   .
#   Keep in mind that a few options only work in standalone mode, such as
#   limiting connections per-IP and binding the server to a specific IP
#   address.
# d-i pure-ftpd/standalone-or-inetd select standalone
# Possible choices: inetd, standalone

### Description: Do you want pure-ftpwho to be installed setuid root?
#   The pure-ftpwho program only works with root privileges. Since it's a
#   fairly trivial program, this poses little security risk. Still, it is only
#   recommended that you install any program setuid root if you need it.

############################
#### qpsmtpd_0.84-11+deb8u1_all.deb
############################

### Description: Enable qpsmtpd startup at boot time?
#   Because most MTAs in Debian listen on one or all network interfaces by
#   default, when first installed qpsmtpd cannot normally be started.
#   .
#   Before enabling qpsmtpd, you must first configure your local MTA not to
#   bind to the SMTP TCP port on at least one interface.  The most common
#   approach is to leave your MTA listening on the loopback interface
#   (127.0.0.1), with qpsmtpd listening on the external interface. 
#   Instructions for configuring common MTAs to work with qpsmtpd can be found
#   after installation in /usr/share/doc/qpsmtpd/README.Debian.
#   .
#   Once you have adjusted your MTA configuration, you can enable qpsmtpd by
#   restarting this configuration, by running 'dpkg-reconfigure qpsmtpd'.
# d-i qpsmtpd/startup_enabled boolean false

### Description: Qpsmtpd server type:
#   Qpsmtpd supports two process models for handling connections.  The
#   'forkserver' model uses a single process when idle, and forks new processes
#   to handle connections.  This uses less memory but slightly reduces
#   server throughput.  The 'prefork' model keeps a pool of idle processes
#   available to handle new connections, offering slightly better performance
#   at the cost of more memory.
# d-i qpsmtpd/server_type select forkserver
# Possible choices: forkserver, prefork

### Description: Addresses on which to listen for incoming SMTP connections:
#   Enter one or more of your local IP addresses, separated by spaces, on
#   which qpsmtpd should listen for incoming SMTP connections.  If you leave
#   this setting empty, qpsmtpd will listen on all interfaces available at
#   startup time.
#   .
#   If you intend to use qpsmtpd to spool deliveries from remote hosts into a
#   local MTA, you may wish to have qpsmtpd listen on all external interfaces,
#   while leaving your local MTA listening on the loopback device (127.0.0.1).
#   .
#   For each interface you may optionally specify a port to listen on instead
#   of the default port 25; do this by appending :<port> to the interface, as
#   in "127.0.0.1:2526".
# d-i qpsmtpd/listen_interfaces string unset

### Description: Queueing method for accepted mail:
#   Select the method for queueing mail once it's been delivered via SMTP.  If
#   you deliver your mail locally, choose the method corresponding to the
#   installed MTA (the installer will try to pick the correct default.)
#   .
#   Select "proxy" if you'd like qpsmtpd to act as an SMTP proxy for another
#   MTA (local or remote).  You will then be prompted to enter a destination
#   host.
#   .
#   Select "maildir" to have qpsmtpd deliver into a local maildir-format spool
#   instead of queueing it for delivery (e.g. if you're setting up a
#   spamtrap.)
#   .
#   If you select "none," no queueing will be done at all, unless you manually
#   configure it yourself by editing /etc/qpsmtpd/plugins.
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_plugin select <choice>
# Possible choices: exim, postfix, qmail, proxy, maildir, none

### Description: Destination host/port for SMTP proxy delivery:
#   To have qpsmtpd act as an SMTP proxy for another host, supply the hostname
#   or IP address of that host here.  You can optionally add a port number
#   after a colon, such as "localhost:25".
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_smtp_proxy_destination string localhost

### Description: Destination Maildir for maildir-type delivery:
#   To have qpsmtpd deliver received mail into a local maildir-format spool,
#   enter a location for that maildir.  A maildir will be created in that
#   location if it does not exist already.
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_maildir_destination string /var/spool/qpsmtpd/Maildir

### Description: Proceed without a queueing plugin selected?
#   By selecting "none" as a queueing plugin, you have disabled local queueing
#   of inbound mail.  This will prevent any mail being spooled by qpsmtpd
#   until you manually configure a queueing method.  Any hosts attempting to
#   deliver mail to you will receive 4xx soft-failure messages until then, at
#   the potential cost of wasted bandwidth and eventual bouncing of possibly
#   legitimate mail.
#   .
#   To configure queueing manually, edit /etc/qpsmtpd/plugins and select one
#   of the queueing methods listed there.  If you didn't see your installed
#   MTA in the list and aren't sure what to do, pick "Cancel" here and
#   select the SMTP proxy method instead, configuring it to proxy into your
#   MTA on a suitable local address/port.
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_none_confirm boolean <choice>

### Description: Destination domain(s) to accept mail for (blank for none):
#   Enter a list of domain name(s) for which qpsmtpd should accept mail,
#   separated by spaces.  This list should include any hostname or domain name
#   for which you intend to accept delivery locally, as well as any recipient
#   domains for which you intend to act as a mail relay.  In general, if you
#   intend to spool received mail into a local MTA, this list should be the
#   same as used for that MTA (the installer will attempt to extract that
#   setting as a default.)
#   .
#   If you prefer to manage this list manually, leave the entry blank and edit
#   the file /etc/qpsmtpd/rcpthosts.
# d-i qpsmtpd/rcpthosts string unset

### Description: Handle RT_SiteConfig.pm permissions?
#   The RT web interface needs access to the database password, stored in the
#   main RT configuration file. Because of this, the file is made readable by
#   the www-data group in normal setups. This may have security implications.
#   .
#   If you reject this option, the file will be readable only by root, and
#   you will have to set up appropriate access controls yourself.

#### resolvconf_1.76.1_all.deb

### Description: Prepare /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates?
#   The resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for

#   /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf. If you choose this option then this
#   link will be created; the existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be
#   preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original, and will be
#   restored if this package is removed.
#   .
#   Declining this option will prevent future installations from
#   recreating the symbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration
#   file will not be dynamically updated. Dynamic updating can then be
#   activated following instructions in the README file.
#   .
#   The presence of resolvconf can affect the behavior of other programs,
#   so it should not be left installed if unconfigured.

### Description: Append original file to dynamic file?
#   If the original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf)

#   information, please consult the resolvconf(8) man page and the
#   README file.
#   .
#   Until /etc/network/interfaces has been edited and the affected
#   interfaces brought down and up again, the name server addresses will
#   not be included in the dynamically generated resolver configuration
#   file.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, a temporary workaround will be put in
#   place: a symbolic link will be created (if it does not already exist)
#   from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to
#   /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original. This will cause the whole of
#   that original resolver configuration file to be appended to the

#   .
#   After the required "dns-nameservers" lines have been added to

#   When run in standalone mode, saned advertises itself on the network and
#   can be detected automatically by the SANE clients with no configuration
#   on the client side. You still need to configure the server to accept

### Description: Restart strongSwan now?
#   Restarting strongSwan is recommended, since if there is a security fix, it
#   will not be applied until the daemon restarts. Most people expect the daemon
#   to restart, so this is generally a good idea. However, this might take down
#   existing connections and then bring them back up, so if you are using such
#   a strongSwan tunnel to connect for this update, restarting is not recommended.
# d-i strongswan/restart boolean true

### Description: Start strongSwan's charon daemon?
#   The charon daemon must be running to support the Internet Key
#   Exchange protocol.
# d-i strongswan/charon boolean true

### Description: Use an X.509 certificate for this host?
#   An X.509 certificate for this host can be automatically created or imported.
#   It can be used to authenticate IPsec connections to other hosts
#   and is the preferred way of building up secure IPsec connections. The other
#   possibility would be to use shared secrets (passwords that are the same on
#   both sides of the tunnel) for authenticating a connection, but for a larger
#   number of connections, key based authentication is easier to administer and
#   more secure.
#   .
#   Alternatively you can reject this option and later use the command
#   "dpkg-reconfigure strongswan" to come back.
# d-i strongswan/install_x509_certificate boolean false

### Description: Methods for using a X.509 certificate to authenticate this host:
#   It is possible to create a new X.509 certificate with user-defined settings
#   or to import an existing public and private key stored in PEM file(s) for
#   authenticating IPsec connections.
#   .
#   If you choose to create a new X.509 certificate you will first be asked
#   a number of questions which must be answered before the creation can start.
#   Please keep in mind that if you want the public key to get signed by
#   an existing Certificate Authority you should not select to create a
#   self-signed certificate and all the answers given must match exactly the
#   requirements of the CA, otherwise the certificate request may be rejected.
#   .
#   If you want to import an existing public and private key you will be
#   prompted for their filenames (which may be identical if both parts are stored
#   together in one file). Optionally you may also specify a filename where the
#   public key(s) of the Certificate Authority are kept, but this file cannot
#   be the same as the former ones. Please also be aware that the format for the
#   X.509 certificates has to be PEM and that the private key must not be encrypted
#   or the import procedure will fail.
# d-i strongswan/how_to_get_x509_certificate select create
# Possible choices: create, import

### Description: File name of your PEM format X.509 certificate:
#   Please enter the location of the file containing your X.509 certificate in
#   PEM format.

### Description: File name of your PEM format X.509 private key:
#   Please enter the location of the file containing the private RSA key
#   matching your X.509 certificate in PEM format. This can be the same file
#   that contains the X.509 certificate.
# d-i strongswan/existing_x509_key_filename string <string>

### Description: File name of your PEM format X.509 RootCA:
#   Optionally you can now enter the location of the file containing the X.509
#   Certificate Authority root used to sign your certificate in PEM format. If you
#   do not have one or do not want to use it please leave the field empty. Please
#   note that it's not possible to store the RootCA in the same file as your X.509
#   certificate or private key.
# d-i strongswan/existing_x509_rootca_filename string <string>

### Description: Please enter which length the created RSA key should have:
#   Please enter the length of the created RSA key. It should not be less than
#   1024 bits because this should be considered unsecure and you will probably
#   not need anything more than 4096 bits because it only slows the
#   authentication process down and is not needed at the moment.
# d-i strongswan/rsa_key_length string 2048

### Description: Create a self-signed X.509 certificate?
#   Only self-signed X.509 certificates can be created
#   automatically, because otherwise a Certificate Authority is needed to sign
#   the certificate request. If you choose to create a self-signed certificate,
#   you can use it immediately to connect to other IPsec hosts that support
#   X.509 certificate for authentication of IPsec connections. However, using
#   strongSwan's PKI features requires all certificates to be signed by a single
#   Certificate Authority to create a trust path.
#   .
#   If you do not choose to create a self-signed certificate, only the RSA
#   private key and the certificate request will be created, and you will
#   have to sign the certificate request with your Certificate Authority.
# d-i strongswan/x509_self_signed boolean true

### Description: Country code for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the two-letter code for the country the server resides in
#   (such as "AT" for Austria).
#   .
#   OpenSSL will refuse to generate a certificate unless this is a valid
#   ISO-3166 country code; an empty field is allowed elsewhere in the X.509
#   certificate, but not here.
# d-i strongswan/x509_country_code string AT

### Description: State or province name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the full name of the state or province the server resides in
#   (such as "Upper Austria").
# d-i strongswan/x509_state_name string 

### Description: Locality name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the locality the server resides in (often a city, such
#   as "Vienna").
# d-i strongswan/x509_locality_name string 

### Description: Organization name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the organization the server belongs to (such as "Debian").
# d-i strongswan/x509_organization_name string 

### Description: Organizational unit for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the organizational unit the server belongs to (such as
#   "security group").
# d-i strongswan/x509_organizational_unit string 

### Description: Common Name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the Common Name for this host (such as
#   "gateway.example.org").
# d-i strongswan/x509_common_name string 

### Description: Email address for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the email address of the person or organization
#   responsible for the X.509 certificate.
# d-i strongswan/x509_email_address string 

### Description: Enable opportunistic encryption?
#   This version of strongSwan supports opportunistic encryption (OE), which stores
#   IPSec authentication information in
#   DNS records. Until this is widely deployed, activating it will
#   cause a significant delay for every new outgoing connection.
#   .
#   You should only enable opportunistic encryption if you are sure you want it.
#   It may break the Internet connection (default route) as the daemon starts.

### Description: Do you wish to upgrade?
#   The format of the Tripwire database and configuration files have changed

#   To ensure your system remains secure, the upgrade process keeps a copy of

#   old databases that may exist.  You will find a detailed explanation for
#   using the old version of Tripwire in
#   /usr/share/doc/tripwire/README.Debian.
#   .
#   However, as no conversion of the old configuration file and database is
#   attempted, you may prefer not to upgrade.
#   .
#   Due to the way Debian handles configuration files, if you choose to
#   upgrade you must accept the new version of /etc/cron.daily/tripwire for
#   regular reporting to occur.  The cron job associated with the previous
#   version will continue to run regardless.
# d-i tripwire/upgrade boolean true

### Description: Do you wish to create/use your site key passphrase during installation?
#   Tripwire uses a pair of keys to sign various files, thus ensuring their

#   passphrase for the first of those keys, the site key, during the
#   installation.  You are also agreeing to create a site key if one
#   doesn't exist already.  Tripwire uses the site key to sign files that may
#   be common to multiple systems, e.g. the configuration & policy files.  See
#   twfiles(5) for more information.
#   .
#   Unfortunately, due to the Debian installation process, there is a period
#   of time where this passphrase exists in a unencrypted format. Were an
#   attacker to have access to your machine during this period, he could
#   possibly retrieve your passphrase and use it at some later point.
#   .
#   If you would rather not have this exposure, decline here.  You will then

#   for instance on a laptop).
# d-i uptimed/interval string 600

### Description: Number of records that should be kept:
#   On systems that reboot frequently, you will get a
#   fairly large list of uptime records pretty soon. To avoid this, uptimed
#   will only keep the n highest uptimes. You may want to limit this to a
#   lower value if you want to get emails each time a record is broken or

### Description: Allow login as root?
#   If you choose not to allow root to log in, then a user account will be
#   created and given the power to become root using the 'sudo' command.
# d-i passwd/root-login boolean true

### Description: Root password:
#   You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative
#   account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have
#   disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password
#   that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries,
#   or a word that could be easily associated with you.
#   .
#   A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
#   and should be changed at regular intervals.
#   .
#   The root user should not have an empty password. If you leave this
#   empty, the root account will be disabled and the system's initial user
#   account will be given the power to become root using the "sudo"
#   command.
#   .
#   Note that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.
# d-i passwd/root-password password <password>

### Description: Re-enter password to verify:
#   Please enter the same root password again to verify that you have typed it
#   correctly.
# d-i passwd/root-password-again password <password>

### Description: Create a normal user account now?
#   It's a bad idea to use the root account for normal day-to-day activities,
#   such as the reading of electronic mail, because even a small mistake can
#   result in disaster. You should create a normal user account to use for
#   those day-to-day tasks.
#   .
#   Note that you may create it later (as well as any additional account) by
#   typing 'adduser <username>' as root, where <username> is an username,
#   like 'imurdock' or 'rms'.
# d-i passwd/make-user boolean true

### Description: Full name for the new user:

#   for instance as default origin for emails sent by this user as well as
#   any program which displays or uses the user's real name. Your full
#   name is a reasonable choice.
# d-i passwd/user-fullname string <string>

### Description: Username for your account:
#   Select a username for the new account. Your first name is a reasonable choice.
#   The username should start with a lower-case letter, which can be
#   followed by any combination of numbers and more lower-case letters.
# d-i passwd/username string <string>

### Description: Choose a password for the new user:
#   A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
#   and should be changed at regular intervals.
# d-i passwd/user-password password <password>

### Description: Re-enter password to verify:
#   Please enter the same user password again to verify you have typed it
#   correctly.
# d-i passwd/user-password-again password <password>

### Description: Enable shadow passwords?
#   Shadow passwords make your system more secure because nobody is able to
#   view even encrypted passwords. The passwords are stored in a separate file
#   that can only be read by special programs. The use of shadow passwords
#   is strongly recommended, except in a few cases such as NIS environments.
# d-i passwd/shadow boolean true

############################
#### uswsusp_1.0+20120915-6_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Swap space to resume from:
#   To be able to suspend the system, uswsusp needs a swap partition or file
#   to store a system snapshot. Please choose the device to use, from the
#   list of suitable swap spaces, sorted by size (largest first).
# d-i uswsusp/resume_device select <choice>
# Possible choices: ${list}

### Description: Offset of swap file's header:
#   When using a swap file for storing the snapshot during suspend, the
#   location of the swap file's header must be specified. This will be
#   stored in <PAGE_SIZE> units, as the offset from the beginning of the
#   partition that contains the swap file.
# d-i uswsusp/resume_offset string <string>

### Description: Continue without a valid swap space?
#   The swap file or partition that was found in uswsusp's configuration
#   file is not active.
#   .
#   In most cases this means userspace software suspend will
#   not work as expected. You should choose another
#   swap space.
#   .
#   However, in some rare cases, this configuration may be intentional.
# d-i uswsusp/continue_without_swap boolean true

### Description: The device node through which uswsusp can talk to the kernel:
#   If this is empty, the hardcoded default, /dev/snapshot, is used.
#   This should be OK in almost all cases. Don't change this unless there is a
#   good reason to do so.
# d-i uswsusp/snapshot_device string <string>

### Description: Preferred maximum image size:
#   Please specify a maximum system snapshot image size (in bytes).
#   .
#   This limit is not strict; the uswsusp does its best to respect it,
#   but will exceed the specified limit if suspend needs a bigger image.
#   .
#   Using 0 here will enforce the use of the smallest possible snapshot
#   image. An empty value will use the hard coded default, which is
#   500MB. The default value is 45% of the system's memory: this is not
#   the maximal size, but some additional free memory speeds up the
#   suspend and resume process.
# d-i uswsusp/image_size string <string>

### Description: Log level for software suspend:
#   Please specify the kernel console log level which the s2disk/s2both
#   and resume utilities will use to report the progress of suspend and
#   resume.  On a stock kernel, messages with levels higher than 7 are
#   usually not shown.
# d-i uswsusp/suspend_loglevel string <string>

### Description: Maximal log level:
#   Please specify the kernel console log level which the resume utility will use
#   if the resume fails.
# d-i uswsusp/max_loglevel string <string>

### Description: Perform checksum on image?
#   Performing a checksum using the MD5 algorithm to verify the image
#   integrity is slightly safer, but also takes more time.
# d-i uswsusp/compute_checksum boolean false

### Description: Compress image?
#   Compressing the image with the LZF compression algorithm will result in a
#   smaller image, which makes it possible to suspend with a smaller swap
#   partition. Generally, it will also make reading and writing the image faster
#   because there is less to read and write.
# d-i uswsusp/compress boolean true

### Description: Perform early write out?
#   The synchronization of the resume device can start early in the
#   process of writing the image to it. This has been reported to speed
#   up suspend on some systems and eliminate the 'fast progress meter and
#   long fsync wait' effect.
# d-i uswsusp/early_writeout boolean true

### Description: Encrypt snapshot?
#   For increased security, it is possible to encrypt the snapshot
#   that is written to disk during suspend. On resume (and suspend if you don't
#   use an RSA key), you will be prompted for a passphrase. Encryption
#   adds a significant time to the suspend and resume processes.
# d-i uswsusp/encrypt boolean false

### Description: Path to RSA key file:
#   To avoid the need for a passphrase prompt during each suspend, an RSA
#   key can be used to encrypt the image.
#   .
#   Please specify the path to that file. Leave this field empty to
#   not use an RSA key.
# d-i uswsusp/RSA_key_file string /etc/uswsusp.key

### Description: Create an RSA key?
#   The key necessary for using the RSA encryption scheme can be generated now.
#   You will be prompted for a passphrase.
# d-i uswsusp/create_RSA_key boolean false

### Description: RSA key size:
#   Please specify the size of the RSA key (number of bits between 1024
#   and 4096). A bigger key increases the encryption strength but slows
#   down the encryption process.
# d-i uswsusp/RSA_key_bits string 1024

### Description: RSA passphrase:
#   Please choose the passphrase to use on every resume to decrypt the
#   image.
# d-i uswsusp/RSA_passphrase password <password>

### Description: RSA passphrase confirmation:
# d-i uswsusp/RSA_passphrase_v password <password>

### Description: Shutdown method:
#   If this parameter is set to 'reboot', the s2disk utility will
#   reboot the machine rather than powering down. This can be useful
#   for testing purposes.
#   .
#   If it is set to 'platform', hardware-specific optimization is used
#   if available.

#   validation of YubiKey OTPs or offline validation of YubiKey HMAC-SHA-1
#   responses to challenges.
#   .
#   The default is online validation, and for that to work you need to get
#   a free API key at https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/ and
#   enter the key id as "id=NNNN" and the base64 secret as "key=...".
#   .
#   All the available parameters for the Yubico PAM module are described
#   in /usr/share/doc/libpam-yubico/README.gz. To avoid accidental
#   lock-outs the module will not be active until it is enabled with the
#   "pam-auth-update" command.

#### zope-common_0.5.54_all.deb
############################

### Description: Automatic restart of Zope instances:
#   Zope offers an extensible, modular structure that allows for the easy
#   addition of extra components (products) or features. These are
#   provided as packages with names that start with a 'zope-' prefix.
#   Each Zope instance needs to be restarted to use any new add-on.
#   .
#   Please choose the default behavior of Zope instances when Zope needs
#   to be restarted:
#   .
#    - configuring: restart instances after each product configuration;
#    - end:         restart instances only once at the end of the whole
#                   installation/upgrading process;
#    - manually:    no automated restart.
# d-i shared/zope/restart select end
# Possible choices: configuring, end, manually

### Description: Action on old/incomplete zope instance '${instance}':
#   An old/incomplete ${instance} instance was found in
#   /var/lib/zope${zver}/instance/${instance}, with no Data.fs file.
#   This installation is either incomplete or incompletely removed.
#   .
#   Choosing 'abort' will allow you to inspect the state of the
#   instance.
#   .
#   Choosing 'remove and continue' will remove /var/lib/zope${zver}/instance/${instance}
#   and reinstall ${instance}. Existing log files in
#   /var/log/zope${zver}/${instance} and configuration files in
#   /etc/zope${zver}/${instance} will be preserved.
# d-i zope-common/remove-instance-without-data select remove and continue
# Possible choices: abort, remove and continue

### Description: Keep data for ${instance} on package purge?
#   Purging the data files of a Zope instance on package purge will
#   result in the loss of all data for that instance. These data files
#   are stored in /var/lib/zope${zver}/instance/${instance}.

#   must not be empty. The password is deleted from the configuration
#   database once the instance is successfully created and cannot be
#   recovered.
#   .
#   This will only be used for instance creation. Please use the
#   following command to change the administrative user login name and

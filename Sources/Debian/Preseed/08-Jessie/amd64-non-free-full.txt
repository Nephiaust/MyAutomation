### Description: ARB PT-server administrators
#   ARB is preconfigured via /etc/arb/arb_tcp.dat with three private PT servers
#   for each user as well as three global PT servers accessible by all users.
#   .
#   Only members of the system group "arb" will be able to build and update
#   the shared PT servers. This setting configures the group members.

#### conserver-client_8.1.18-2.2_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Do you want to configure console automatically?
#   Setting this to true will edit /etc/conserver/console.cf
#   and replace CONSERVER_MASTER and CONSERVER_PORT with the
#   configured values in the next questions
# d-i conserver-client/config boolean true

### Description: Hostname where your conserver server is installed:
#   The conserver hostname is the hostname where the conserver-server
#   package is installed. The client, 'console', will use the hostname 'console'
#   if left empty. The server name can be changed during runtime with
#   the -M option.
# d-i conserver-client/server string localhost

### Description: The server port number to connect to:
#   Set the conserver server port to connect to. This may be either a port
#   number or a service name.
# d-i conserver-client/port string 3109

############################
#### conserver-server_8.1.18-2.2_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: The master port number for the conserver server:
#   Set the TCP port for the master process to listen on for clients. This may
#   be either a port number or a service name. The original port number for
#   conserver is 782, must be higher than 1024 if running as non-root.
# d-i conserver-server/port string 3109

### Description: The base port number for the conserver children:
#   Set the base port for children to listen on. Each child starts looking for
#   free ports at this port number and working upward, trying a maximum number
#   of ports equal to twice the maximum number of groups. If no free ports are
#   available in that range, conserver exits. By default, conserver lets the
#   operating system choose a free port.
#   Empty input selects the default.
#   (Conserver forks a child for each group of consoles it must manage and
#   assigns each process a port number to listen on.)
# d-i conserver-server/base_port string <string>

### Description: The listen address (defaults to all addresses if empty):
#   Set the address to listen on.  This allows conserver to bind to a
#   particular IP address (like `127.0.0.1') instead of all interfaces. The
#   default is to bind to all interfaces.
# d-i conserver-server/listen_address string <string>

### Description: Should conserver run as root?
#   Conserver can be configured to run as root or as 'conservr'. It is not
#   possible to use the shadow password if running as non-root in
#   conserver.passwd. (See the manual for conserver.passwd for more details.)
# d-i conserver-server/run_as_root boolean false

### Description: Convert conserver.cf and conserver.passwd to new format?
#   Protocol and file format has changed!
#   The client/server protocol has been rearchitected. You *MUST* use an 8.0.1
#   client with an 8.0.1 server.  No combination of client/server will work
#   with pre-8.0.0 code.
#   The config file format for both conserver.cf and conserver.passwd has been
#   changed, read /usr/share/doc/conserver-server/README.Debian for more
#   details.
#   The /etc/conserver/conserver.cf and /etc/conserver/conserver.passwd will be
#   converted to the new format and the old will be renamed with .OLD as suffix.
#   Check the files after the conversion!
# d-i conserver-server/upgrade_800_flag boolean true

############################
#### distributed-net_2.9111.520-2_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Run the distributed.net client configuration utility?
#   The distributed.net client needs to be configured before it can be used.
#   While most options have reasonable defaults, you need to specify the e-mail
#   address to which you would like distributed.net to credit any work done by
#   the client. If you are installing the distributed-net package for the first
#   time, then you must configure the client, otherwise the distributed.net client
#   will refuse to start.
#   .
#   When the distributed.net client is run as a daemon (via /etc/init.d/distributed-net),
#   the output will be redirected to /var/log/distributed-net.log. You do not
#   need to set up a log file. Since the init script is controlling the
#   distributed.net client, you should not enable "quiet mode" as that breaks the
#   init script.

### Description: for internal use
#   Can be preseeded. If set to false, disables the check for
#   legacy GPUs based on R6XX/R7XX.
# d-i fglrx-driver/check-for-unsupported-gpu boolean true

### Description: Install ${vendor} driver despite unsupported graphics card?
#   This system has a graphics card which is no longer handled by the ${vendor}
#   driver (package ${driver}). You may wish to keep the package installed -
#   for instance to drive some other card - but the card with the following
#   chipset won't be usable:
#   .
#   ${unsupported-device}
#   .
#   The above card requires either the non-free legacy ${vendor} driver
#   (package ${legacy_driver}) or the free ${free_name} driver
#   (package ${free_driver}).
#   .
#   Before the ${free_name} driver can be used you must
#   remove ${vendor} configuration from xorg.conf (and xorg.conf.d/).

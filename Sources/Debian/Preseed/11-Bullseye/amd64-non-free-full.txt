### Description: Run the distributed.net client configuration utility?
#   The distributed.net client needs to be configured before it can be used.
#   While most options have reasonable defaults, you need to specify the e-mail
#   address to which you would like distributed.net to credit any work done by
#   the client. If you are installing the distributed-net package for the first
#   time, then you must configure the client, otherwise the distributed.net client
#   will refuse to start.
#   .
#   When the distributed.net client is run as a daemon (via /etc/init.d/distributed-net),
#   the output will be redirected to /var/log/distributed-net.log. You do not
#   need to set up a log file. Since the init script is controlling the
#   distributed.net client, you should not enable "quiet mode" as that breaks the
#   init script.

### Description: Use libmkl_rt.so as the default alternative to BLAS/LAPACK?
#   Intel MKL's Single Dynamic Library (SDL) is installed on your machine. This
#   shared object can be used as an alternative to both libblas.so.3 and
#   liblapack.so.3, so that packages built against BLAS/LAPACK can directly use
#   MKL without rebuild.
#   .
#   However, MKL is non-free software, and in particular its source code is not
#   publicly available. By using MKL as the default BLAS/LAPACK implementation,
#   you might be violating the licensing terms of copyleft software that would
#   become dynamically linked against it. Please verify that the licensing terms
